        "Background. Psychodynamic psychotherapy is a psychological treatment approach that has a growing empirical base.

This model has neither been evaluated for depression nor anxiety disorders in a randomized controlled trial. While Internet-delivered psychodynamic treatments for depression and generalized anxiety disorder exist, they have not been based on APT. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of an Internet-based, psychodynamic, guided self-help treatment based on APT for depression and anxiety disorders.Methods. One hundred participants with diagnoses of mood and anxiety disorders participated in a randomized (1:1 ratio) controlled trial of an active group versus a control condition. The treatment group received a 10-week, psychodynamic, guided self-help treatment based on APT that was delivered through the Internet. The treatment consisted of eight text-based treatment modules and included therapist contact (9.5 min per client and week, on average) in a secure online environment. Participants in the control group also received online therapist support and clinical monitoring of symptoms, but received no treatment modules. Outcome measures were the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-9) and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Process measures were also included. All measures were administered weekly during the treatment period and at a 7-month follow-up.Results.

A large between-group effect size of Cohen’s d = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.37–1.18) was found on the PHQ-9 and a moderately large between-group effect size d = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.08–0.87) was found on the GAD-7. The number of patients who recovered (had no diagnoses of depression and anxiety, and had less than 10 on both the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7) were at post-treatment 52% in the treatment group and 24% in the control group. This difference was significant, χ2(N = 100, d f = 1) = 8.3, p < .01. From post-treatment to follow-up, treatment gains were maintained on the PHQ-9, and significant improvements were seen on the GAD-7.Conclusion.

Thus, keeping a focus on affect may be one way of enhancing psychodynamic psychotherapies.</p>\n<p id=\"p-4\">One psychodynamic treatment that has a strong focus on expression and experience of affect is affect-phobia therapy (APT), developed by <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Treating%20affect%20phobia:%20a%20manual%20for%20short-term%20dynamic%20psychotherapy&amp;author=McCullough&amp;publication_year=2003\" title=\"Treating affect phobia: a manual for short-term dynamic psychotherapy\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-39\">McCullough et al. (2003)</a>. APT follows a treatment model which adheres to the fundamental structure of psychodynamic psychotherapy as outlined by Malan’s triangle of conflict (i.e., the experience/expression of feelings (F) is blocked by defenses (D) and anxieties (A)) and triangle of person (i.e., conflicted patterns began with past persons (P), are maintained with current persons (C), and can be enacted with a therapist (T)), as illustrated in <a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-2\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-2\">Fig. 2</a> (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Individual%20psychotherapy%20and%20the%20science%20of%20psychodynamics&amp;author=Malan&amp;publication_year=1995\" title=\"Individual psychotherapy and the science of psychodynamics\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-37\">Malan, 1995</a>). Typically in APT, the therapist clarifies a client’s defenses, helps the client to observe and experience the underlying affects, and helps the client to regulate associated anxiety (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Treating%20affect%20phobia:%20a%20manual%20for%20short-term%20dynamic%20psychotherapy&amp;author=McCullough&amp;publication_year=2003\" title=\"Treating affect phobia: a manual for short-term dynamic psychotherapy\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-39\">McCullough et al., 2003</a>). Formally, the treatment includes three main treatment objectives: defense restructuring (recognizing and relinquishing maladaptive defenses), affect restructuring (desensitization of affects through exposure to conflicted feeling), and self/other restructuring (improvement in sense of self and relationship with others). The main goal of psychodynamic psychotherapy based on the APT model is to help clients experience and to adaptively express previously avoided feelings (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Treating%20affect%20phobia:%20a%20manual%20for%20short-term%20dynamic%20psychotherapy&amp;author=McCullough&amp;publication_year=2003\" title=\"Treating affect phobia: a manual for short-term dynamic psychotherapy\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-39\">McCullough et al., 2003</a>). That goal is shared with an entire set of psychodynamic psychotherapies that are grouped under the umbrella term <i>experiential dynamic therapies</i> (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Theory%20and%20practice%20of%20experiential%20dynamic%20psychotherapy&amp;author=Osimo&amp;publication_year=2012\" title=\"Theory and practice of experiential dynamic psychotherapy\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-43\">Osimo &amp; Stein, 2012</a>), which in addition to APT includes, for example, Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.3109%2F10673229.2012.677347\" title=\"Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of outcome research\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-1\">Abbass, Town &amp; Driessen, 2012</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Intensive%20short-term%20dynamic%20psychotherapy:%20selected%20papers%20of%20Habib%20Davanloo&amp;author=Davanloo&amp;publication_year=2000\" title=\"Intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy: selected papers of Habib Davanloo\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-14\">Davanloo, 2000</a>), and Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=The%20transforming%20power%20of%20affect:%20a%20model%20for%20accelerated%20change&amp;author=Fosha&amp;publication_year=2000\" title=\"The transforming power of affect: a model for accelerated change\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-21\">Fosha, 2000</a>).

As compared with the control condition, a significant effect of treatment was expected both on measures of depression and anxiety for the full sample. In addition, a larger effect was expected on measures of depression for participants with depression as their main presenting problem as compared with those who did not have this as the main problem. Similar, a larger effect on anxiety measures was expected for participants with a principal anxiety diagnosis as compared with those who did not have such a diagnosis.

        "<h2 class=\"heading\">Discussion</h2>\n<p id=\"p-40\">This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effects of affect-phobia therapy in the format of guided self-help through the Internet in a sample of participants with depression and anxiety disorders. The results indicated that the treatment was effective in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety, and also in facilitating emotional processing and mindfulness skills. Subgroup analyses gave no indications of differential efficacy between participants with a principal diagnosis of depression and those with principal anxiety. Treatment gains were maintained in the 7-month follow-up.</p>\n<p id=\"p-41\">The treatment manual used in this study aimed to implement a psychodynamic treatment based on the affect-phobia model in self-help format. This approach calls for a discussion on similarities and differences to the original APT manual. An assumption of this implementation was that the core principles of affect-phobia treatment manual could be retained. This included the general model of psychopathology (i.e., as illustrated by the triangle of conflict in <a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-2\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-2\">Fig. 2</a>) and the overall structure of the therapy. While the treatment emphasized how affect-phobic patterns in a person’s current life (C) began with past persons (P), as illustrated in Malan’s triangle of person, the treatment did not address how these patterns could potentially be enacted with the therapist (T). Importantly, these patterns were not regarded as non-existing, but rather the treatment material did not address them nor was it part of the role of the therapists to address these patterns. While the therapist role might overlap between guided self-help and face-to-face therapy in several aspects (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1017%2FS1352465812000240\" title=\"Therapist behaviours in internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy: analyses of e-mail correspondence in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-44\">Paxling et al., 2013</a>), there is a difference in the present study in how the treatment material taught “emotional mindfulness” as a way of conducting exposure to one’s feelings without the therapist being present. Some authors have suggested that exposure with response prevention may result in better effects of treatment when patients conduct the exposure by themselves, in their natural environment (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0005-7967%2876%2990041-3\" title=\"Obsessional-compulsive checking: experimental replication and development\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-45\">Röper &amp; Rachman, 1976</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2F0005-7967%2885%2990105-6\" title=\"Obsessional-compulsive problems: a cognitive-behavioural analysis\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-46\">Salkovskis, 1985</a>). If this is also the case in affect-phobia therapy and how that would affect outcome is a question for further research, but it is possible that self-exposure to feelings is at least as effective as exposure with a therapist present. Importantly, as exposure with response prevention is assumed to be an active mechanism in the treatment tested in this study, this would imply similarities in working mechanisms in affect-focused psychodynamic treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy based on principles of exposure. Similarly, several contemporary CBT treatments have components of emotion regulation techniques (e.g., <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1159%2F000348448\" title=\"Emotion regulation skills training enhances the efficacy of inpatient cognitive behavioral therapy for major depressive disorder: a randomized controlled trial\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-8\">Berking et al., 2013</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1017%2FS0033291713000068\" title=\"Augmenting cognitive behaviour therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder with emotion tolerance training: a randomized controlled trial\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-10\">Bryant et al., 2013</a>), that seem overlapping to affect-phobia treatment. Future research should investigate further similarities and differences between affect-focused psychodynamic therapy and various CBT models. Summing up, despite the aforementioned differences to the original APT manual, we believe that the manual used in the current study is indeed a valid implementation of a psychodynamic therapy based on the affect-phobia model.</p>\n<p id=\"p-42\">In affect-phobia therapy, the model of psychopathology is the same across disorders, i.e., the triangle of conflict is assumed to explain both etiology and maintenance of for example depression and anxiety disorders (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Treating%20affect%20phobia:%20a%20manual%20for%20short-term%20dynamic%20psychotherapy&amp;author=McCullough&amp;publication_year=2003\" title=\"Treating affect phobia: a manual for short-term dynamic psychotherapy\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-39\">McCullough et al., 2003</a>). This aim is similar to transdiagnostic and unified protocols where the treatment material has been arranged to fit a broader range of patients (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0005-7894%2804%2980036-4\" title=\"Toward a unified treatment for emotional disorders\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-6\">Barlow, Allen &amp; Choate, 2004</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fda.21992\" title=\"Transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety and depression\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-12\">Craske, 2012</a>). Hence, affect-phobia therapy could be described as a transdiagnostic treatment. While there are several studies on the efficacy of cognitive behavioral transdiagnostic treatments for anxiety disorders (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.beth.2012.01.001\" title=\"Unified protocol for transdiagnostic treatment of emotional disorders: a randomized controlled trial\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-20\">Farchione et al., 2012</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1891%2F0889-8391.23.1.20\" title=\"Efficacy of transdiagnostic treatments: a review of published outcome studies and future research directions\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-41\">McEvoy, Nathan &amp; Norton, 2009</a>), few exist that explicitly target both depression and anxiety. However, one uncontrolled trial testing the effectiveness of a group-based intervention (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1037%2F0022-006X.75.2.344\" title=\"Effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy for diagnostically heterogeneous groups: a benchmarking study\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-40\">McEvoy &amp; Nathan, 2007</a>) resulted in promising outcomes and showed comparable efficacy to several disorder-specific treatments. More recently, <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.brat.2011.03.007\" title=\"Transdiagnostic internet treatment for anxiety and depression: a randomised controlled trial\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-53\">Titov et al. (2011)</a> provided evidence of the efficacy of an Internet-delivered transdiagnostic program that targeted both anxiety and depression, when compared to a waiting-list. Both these treatments yielded within-group effect sizes of Cohen’s <i>d</i> around 1.0 for measures of depression and anxiety. Hence, the affect-phobia treatment tested in this study, seems to stand well when compared to other transdiagnostic treatments tested.</p>\n<p id=\"p-43\">There are methodological limitations that need to be considered. First, as we recruited participants from the community and not from, for example, a treatment clinic, the external validity of the findings are challenging to interpret. While there are studies on ICBT that suggests generalizability to clinical settings (e.g., <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2F1471-244X-10-54\" title=\"Internet-versus group-administered cognitive behaviour therapy for panic disorder in a psychiatric setting: a randomised trial\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-7\">Bergström et al., 2010</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Facps.12079\" title=\"Effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy for panic disorder in routine psychiatric care\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-27\">Hedman et al., 2013</a>), this has yet to be proven for Internet-delivered psychodynamic therapy. Moreover, more than half of the participants in the present study had three years or more of university education. While this factor might have biased the results, the average severity of depression and anxiety symptoms was moderate to moderately severe (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.genhosppsych.2010.03.006\" title=\"The patient health questionnaire somatic, anxiety, and depressive symptom scales: a systematic review\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-33\">Kroenke et al., 2010</a>), and more than half of the participants had comorbid disorders, suggesting clinical representativity (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1146%2Fannurev.clinpsy.3.022806.091444\" title=\"Prevalence, comorbidity, and service utilization for mood disorders in the United States at the beginning of the twenty-first century\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-31\">Kessler, Merikangas &amp; Wang, 2007</a>). A second methodological limitation concerns the substantial within-group effects in the control group that make the results harder to interpret. These effects are probably due to the weekly clinical monitoring and supportive contact with the therapists in addition to the extensive test procedures such as telephone interviews before and after the treatment period. While these aspects might have biased the results, it also highlights the need for research regarding specific factors in guided self-help treatments. A third limitation concerns how missing data were handled at the 7-month follow-up for the categorical measure of recovery. For that measure, missing data at follow-up were replaced by that from post-treatment. When using that approach in longitudinal analysis, there is a known risk for estimation bias (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1001%2Farchpsyc.61.3.310\" title=\"Move over ANOVA: progress in analyzing repeated-measures data and its reflection in papers published in the Archives of General Psychiatry\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-24\">Gueorguieva &amp; Krystal, 2004</a>). While we did not compare the recovery rates over time (i.e., did not include this measure in any longitudinal analysis) we still acknowledge that some method of multiple imputation could have been used to account for the missing data (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1146%2Fannurev.psych.58.110405.085530\" title=\"Missing data analysis: making it work in the real world\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-23\">Graham, 2009</a>). Another limitation concerns the subgroup analyses. As the total sample size was appropriate for the comparison between treatment and control, it seemed not to have been adequate for the analyses regarding subgroups of principal depression and anxiety. This implies that a larger sample size would be needed in future research if investigating the effect of a transdiagnostic treatment on specific diagnoses in a sample with multiple disorders. A related limitation concerns the definition of the subgroups in this study. The group with principal anxiety disorders is a heterogeneous group, e.g., in the sense that it includes both fear disorders (e.g., panic disorder) and worry disorders (GAD). This may have confounded the subgroup analyses. A final limitation that needs to be addressed concerns the therapists in the study, all of whom were psychologists in training, albeit during the last semester of training in a five year program and under regular supervision. It is possible that more experienced therapists would have enabled even larger treatment effects. A related concern is that psychologists in training conducted all diagnostic interviews. While the psychologists were explicitly trained in the diagnostic procedures and received supervision, there is a possibility that their level of experience may have affected how the diagnostic categories were defined. Importantly though, the MINI interview has been designed to be administered by non-experts.</p>"

DNHM D2945 preserves the bones of the skull, most of the axial skeleton, right radius, major digit and tibiotarsus, and both feet (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-1\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-1\">Figs. 1</a> and <a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-2\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-2\">2</a>). DNHM D2946 preserves most of the bones of the wings and thoracic girdle, both femora, the left tibiotarsus, and the distal ends of the pubes (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-3\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-3\">Figs. 3</a> and <a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-4\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-4\">4</a>).</p>\n<section class=\"sec\"><h4 class=\"heading\">Skull</h4>\n<p id=\"p-15\">The skull is rather poorly preserved, embedded in a well-indurated rusty concretion; the shape of the skull is well preserved, but few anatomical details can be discerned (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-5\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-5\">Fig. 5</a>).

The presence of teeth in the premaxilla, however, cannot be determined in DNHM D2945.

The fragmentary remains of two to four teeth are preserved set in the dentary. This confirms the presence of teeth in the dentary of hongshanornithids, which was hypothesized by <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F02724631003617498\" title=\"A new ornithuromorph (Aves: Ornithothoraces) bird from the Jehol Group indicative of higher-level diversity\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-36\">O’Connor, Gao &amp; Chiappe (2010)</a>. Crowns cannot be discerned, but the dentary teeth appear to be smaller than those preserved in the maxilla. The dentary is caudally unforked and unfused to the surangular, as in other basal ornithuromorphs.</p></section><section class=\"sec\"><h4 class=\"heading\">Axial skeleton</h4>\n<p id=\"p-18\">The cervical vertebrae are poorly preserved, revealing little more than the remnants of low neural spines. The anterior dorsal vertebrae (visible in ventral view in DNHM D2945) bear compressed centra lacking ventral processes; the posterior dorsals have thicker centra. The articulations are amphyplatan or amphicoelic and the elements are not fused in a notarium. The lateral surfaces of the dorsal vertebrae are excavated by a broad fossa, as in other basal ornithuromorphs (e.g., <i>Yanornis martini, Longicrusavis houi</i>).</p>\n<p id=\"p-19\">The synsacrum is incomplete and broken between the two slabs (dorsally exposed in DNHM D2946 and ventrally exposed in DNHM D2945) (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-1\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-1\">Figs. 1</a>–<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-4\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-4\">4</a>). A number of well-differentiated costal processes project from the side of the synsacrum—these processes have expanded distal ends for their attachment to the ilium. Judging by the number of costal processes articulated to the ilium, the synsacrum was composed of no less than nine vertebrae (the synsacral count cannot be determined in either the holotype of <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> or <i>Longicrusavis houi</i>), which is comparable to other basal ornithuromorphs and more than is typical of the more primitive enantiornithines (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Late%20Cretaceous%20birds%20of%20southern%20South%20America:%20anatomy%20and%20systematics%20of%20Enantiornithes%20and%20Patagopteryx%20deferrariisi&amp;author=Chiappe&amp;publication_year=1996\" title=\"Late Cretaceous birds of southern South America: anatomy and systematics of Enantiornithes and Patagopteryx deferrariisi\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-6\">Chiappe, 1996</a>). The ventral surface of the synsacrum (anterior half preserved in DNHM D2945) is smooth, lacking a distinct groove (e.g., <i>Archaeorhynchus spathula</i>, <i>Patagopteryx deferrariisi</i>). Dorsally, the portion of synsacrum preserved in slab DNHM D2946—corresponding largely to the postacetabular portion—is longitudinally scarred by a pair of shallow grooves.</p>\n<p id=\"p-20\">At least four uncinate processes can be discerned, including one that is completely preserved (DNHM D2946). These ossifications are long (extending across two ribs) with broad bases and tapered outlines (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-6\">Fig. 6</a>). The uncinate processes appear not to be fused to the ribs, as in the holotype. Several ventral ribs are preserved in articulation with the sternum (DNHM D2946). The proximal ends of the thoracic ribs are very robust, the expanded proximal portion abruptly narrows towards the much thinner shaft (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-6\">Fig. 6</a>).</p>\n<figure class=\"fig\" id=\"fig-6\"><div class=\"image-container\"><a href=\"https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-2x.jpg\" title=\"View the full image\" class=\"fresco\" data-fresco-caption=\"Figure 6: Photograph (A) and interpretive drawing (B) of the thoracic girdle and vertebral series, rib cage, and humeri of DNHM D2946.\" data-fresco-group=\"figure\" data-fresco-options=\"fit: 'width', ui: 'outside', thumbnails: false, loop: true, position: true, preload: false\"><img class=\"graphic\" src=\"https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-1x.jpg\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 581px, (max-width: 1199px) and (min-width: 980px) 462px, (max-width: 979px) and (min-width: 768px) 347px, (max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 50px)\" srcset=\"https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-2x.jpg 1200w, https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-1x.jpg 600w, https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-small.jpg 355w\" data-image-id=\"fig-6\" alt=\"Photograph (A) and interpretive drawing (B) of the thoracic girdle and vertebral series, rib cage, and humeri of DNHM D2946.\" data-full=\"https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-full.png\" data-thumb=\"https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-thumb.jpg\" data-original=\"https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6.png\" data-image-type=\"figure\" data-jats-mimetype=\"image\" data-jats-mime-subtype=\"png\" /></a></div>\n<figcaption><h5 class=\"heading\">\n<span class=\"caption-label\">Figure 6: </span>Photograph (A) and interpretive drawing (B) of the thoracic girdle and vertebral series, rib cage, and humeri of DNHM D2946.</h5>\n<span class=\"p\">Abbreviations: co, coracoid; fu, furcula; hu, humerus; lt, lateral trabecular; ra, radius; rb, ribs; sc, scapula; sp, supracondylar process; st, sternum; up, uncinate process.</span><div class=\"figcaption-footer\">\n<div class=\"article-image-download\"><a href=\"https://dfzljdn9uc3pi.cloudfront.net/2014/234/1/fig-6-full.png\" class=\"btn btn-mini\" download=\"peerj-234-fig-6.png\"><i class=\"icon-large icon-picture\">&nbsp;</i> Download full-size image</a></div>\n<div class=\"object-id article-component-doi\">DOI: <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.234/fig-6\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" title=\"Cite this object using this DOI\">10.7717/peerj.234/fig-6</a>\n</div>\n</div></figcaption></figure></section><section class=\"sec\"><h4 class=\"heading\">Appendicular skeleton</h4>\n<p id=\"p-22\">The furcula is delicate and U-shaped as in many other basal ornithuromorpha (e.g., <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1469-7580.2006.00534.x\" title=\"Insight into the evolution of avian flight from a new clade of Early Cretaceous ornithurines from China and the morphology of Yixianornis grabaui\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-11\">Clarke, Zhou &amp; Zhang, 2006</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1126%2Fscience.1126377\" title=\"A nearly modern amphibious bird from the Early Cretaceous of northwestern China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-52\">You et al., 2006</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A%20New%20Basal%20Ornithurine%20Bird%20(Jianchangornis%20microdonta%20gen.%20et%20sp.%20nov.)%20from%20the%20Lower%20Cretaceous%20of%20China&amp;author=Zhou&amp;publication_year=2009\" title=\"A New Basal Ornithurine Bird (Jianchangornis microdonta gen. et sp. nov.) from the Lower Cretaceous of China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-63\">Zhou, Zhang &amp; Li, 2009</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F02724634.2012.714431\" title=\"Anatomy of the Basal Ornithuromorph Bird Archaeorhynchus spathula from the Early Cretaceous of Liaoning, China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-66\">Zhou, Zhou &amp; O’Connor, 2013b</a>). The interclavicular angle is estimated to be approximately 45°(<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-6\">Fig. 6</a>). The rami are transversely compressed proximally, becoming more dorsoventrally compressed and wider towards the symphysis. The caudal surface of the bone exhibits a distinct trough running along the distal half of the rami and converging towards the symphysial region. The proximal compression and caudal groove of the furcula of DNHM D2946 are comparable to that reported by <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A%20new%20ornithurine%20bird%20(Hongshanornithidae)%20from%20the%20Jiufotang%20Formation%20of%20Chaoyang,%20Liaoning,%20China&amp;author=Li&amp;publication_year=2011\" title=\"A new ornithurine bird (Hongshanornithidae) from the Jiufotang Formation of Chaoyang, Liaoning, China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-28\">Li, Wang &amp; Hou (2011)</a> as diagnostic characters of <i>Parahongshanornis chaoyangensis</i>. The presence of these conditions in DNHM D2946 indicates that such characters are unlikely to be diagnostic of the latter taxon. A cross section of the furcula in slab DNHM D2945 indicates the bone may have been hollow. No long hypocleidium like that reported in the holotype of <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> (IVPP V14533) is visible but the symphysial region of DNHM D2945/46 is covered by the distal portion of the left coracoid, thus making it unclear if a hypocleidium was present or not. The similarity between the furcula of DNHM D2945/46 and that of <i>Longicrusavis houi</i> and <i>Parahongshanornis chaoyangensis</i>, taxa lacking a long hypocleidium and possessing only a small tubercle at the symphysis (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F02724631003617498\" title=\"A new ornithuromorph (Aves: Ornithothoraces) bird from the Jehol Group indicative of higher-level diversity\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-36\">O’Connor, Gao &amp; Chiappe, 2010</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A%20new%20ornithurine%20bird%20(Hongshanornithidae)%20from%20the%20Jiufotang%20Formation%20of%20Chaoyang,%20Liaoning,%20China&amp;author=Li&amp;publication_year=2011\" title=\"A new ornithurine bird (Hongshanornithidae) from the Jiufotang Formation of Chaoyang, Liaoning, China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-28\">Li, Wang &amp; Hou, 2011</a>), suggests that the furcula of hongshanornithids possibly lacked a well-developed hypocleidium.</p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">The sternum, primarily preserved in DNHM D2946 in dorsal view, has a slightly rounded cranial margin (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-6\">Fig. 6</a>). Distally on the left side of the sternum, a bony bar with a terminal expansion is preserved. Damage makes it difficult to interpret this region of the sternum. One alternative is that this bar corresponds to a slightly displaced, lateral trabecula with an expanded distal end; the lateral trabecula of the sternum of various basal ornithuromorphs (e.g., <i>Archaeorhynchus spathula</i>, <i>Jianchangornis microdonta</i>, <i>Yixianornis grabaui</i>, <i>Yanornis martini</i>) is distally expanded in varying degrees (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F02724634.2012.714431\" title=\"Anatomy of the Basal Ornithuromorph Bird Archaeorhynchus spathula from the Early Cretaceous of Liaoning, China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-66\">Zhou, Zhou &amp; O’Connor, 2013b</a>).

Distally, the margin of the crest gradually diminishes along the dorsal border of the shaft, typical of Cretaceous ornithuromorphs (e.g., <i>Jianchangornis microdonta, Yixianornis grabaui, Archaeorhynchus spathula</i>), as opposed to the rapid step-like constriction of this crest in most basal birds (e.g., <i>Confuciusornis sanctus, Sapeornis chaoyangensis, Rapaxavis pani</i>) and some basal ornithuromorphs (e.g., <i>Schizooura lii, Zhongjianornis yangi</i>).</p>\n<p id=\"p-26\">In caudal view (DNHM D2946) the distal humeri bear no evidence of humerotriciptial or scapulotricipital grooves (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-6\">Fig. 6</a>).

Its laterodistal end is exposed in DNHM D2946; similar to other Jehol ornithuromorphs (e.g., <i>Yixianornis grabaui</i>), there is minimal development of the fibular trochlea and tibiofibular crest, which are developed in <i>Patagopteryx deferrariisi</i> and ornithurines (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Basal%20bird%20phylogeny:%20problems%20and%20solutions&amp;author=Chiappe&amp;publication_year=2002\" title=\"Basal bird phylogeny: problems and solutions\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-7\">Chiappe, 2002</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1206%2F0003-0090%282004%29286%3C0001%3AMPTASO%3E2.0.CO%3B2\" title=\"Morphology, phylogenetic taxonomy, and systematics of Ichthyornis and Apatornis (Avialae: Ornithurae)\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-10\">Clarke, 2004</a>).</p>\n<p id=\"p-35\">The tibiotarsus is more than 150% the length of the femur (tibiotarsus: femur = 1.6) (<a class=\"xref xref-table\" href=\"#table-1\" data-jats-ref-type=\"table\" data-jats-rid=\"table-1\">Table 1</a>).

The intercotylar prominence is at best minimally developed. The proximal cotyla are slightly concave—the lateral one is slightly more distally placed than the medial one. Metatarsal III is plantarly displaced so that proximally, metatarsal II and metatarsal IV form ridges defining a recess excavating the central portion of the tarsometatarsus. Such morphology is consistent with that of other basal ornithuromorphs (e.g., <i>Yanornis martini</i>, <i>Yixianornis grabaui</i>, <i>Gansus yumenensis</i>, <i>Ichthyornis dispar</i>). Inside this proximocentral recess there is a foramen located between metatarsals III and IV, and medial to it, a tubercle on metatarsal II (possibly corresponding to the <i>m. tibialis cranialis</i> tuberosity of modern birds). Metatarsal III is the longest; metatarsal IV is slightly shorter, followed by the even shorter metatarsal II (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-10\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-10\">Fig. 10</a>). Metatarsal I is robust and fairly straight, with a concave medial margin. A distal vascular foramen is located between metatarsals III and IV as in <i>Longicrusavis houi</i>; the distal margin of the foramen is raised. The foramen seems to penetrate the bone at an oblique angle—from cranial to plantar surfaces.

The caudal margin of the feathered tail is rounded and the pair of central rectrices projects distally more than the feathers on either side, thus suggesting a gently graded tail (comparable to the one described for <i>Piscivoravis lii</i>; see <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F08912963.2013.819504\" title=\"A new piscivorous ornithuromorph from the Jehol Biota\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-65\">Zhou, Zhou &amp; O’Connor, 2013a</a>).

DNHM D2945/6 is from the same locality and formation (Yixian) that yielded the closely related <i>Longicrusavis houi</i> (PKVP 1069; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F02724631003617498\" title=\"A new ornithuromorph (Aves: Ornithothoraces) bird from the Jehol Group indicative of higher-level diversity\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-36\">O’Connor, Gao &amp; Chiappe, 2010</a>). The coexistence of these two closely related taxa in a single fauna suggests that Hongshanornithidae was a diverse component of the avifauna of the Yixian Formation.</p>\n<p id=\"p-47\">DNHM D2945/6 reveals important new information regarding the morphology, diet, and ecology of <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> and other Early Cretaceous ornithuromorphs. The new specimen of <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> preserves actual fossilized bone rather than voids of bone, as in the holotype (IVPP V 14533), and as such this new specimen helps clarify the osteology of the taxon. DNHM D2945/6 documents the presence of two different skull morphologies within Hongshanornithidae. It also confirms that the upper and lower jaws of these birds were toothed, a conclusion previously suggested by morphologies preserved in the holotype of <i>Longicrusavis houi</i> (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F02724631003617498\" title=\"A new ornithuromorph (Aves: Ornithothoraces) bird from the Jehol Group indicative of higher-level diversity\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-36\">O’Connor, Gao &amp; Chiappe, 2010</a>). Additionally, DNHM D2945/6 shows that the lateral margin of the coracoid of hongshanornithids was concave, as is typical of other basal ornithuromorphs, and not convex as reported by <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.0507106102\" title=\"Discovery of an ornithurine bird and its implication for Early Cretaceous avian radiation\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-60\">Zhou &amp; Zhang (2005)</a>. DNHM D2945/6 also preserves a dorsal supracondylar process, a feature present in <i>Longicrusavis houi</i> and many extant shorebirds.</p>\n<p id=\"p-48\">The presence of a hypocleidium in <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> is still controversial. This process does not appear present in DNHM D2945/6, however preservation prevents us from making an unequivocal statement. While most known Early Cretaceous ornithuromorphs do not possess even the smallest hypocleidium, basal ornithuromorphs with furculae bearing a distinct hypocleidium have been recently reported (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A%20new%20toothless%20ornithurine%20bird%20(Schizooura%20lii%20gen.%20et%20sp.%20nov.)%20from%20the%20Lower%20Cretaceous%20of%20China&amp;author=Zhou&amp;publication_year=2012\" title=\"A new toothless ornithurine bird (Schizooura lii gen. et sp. nov.) from the Lower Cretaceous of China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-64\">Zhou, Zhou &amp; O’Connor, 2012</a>). Such discoveries lend credibility to Zhou and Zhang’s (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.0507106102\" title=\"Discovery of an ornithurine bird and its implication for Early Cretaceous avian radiation\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-60\">2005</a>) claim that the furcula of <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> possessed a hypocleidium, although well-preserved specimens are necessary to corroborate such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"p-49\">Furthermore, the anatomy of DNHM D2945/6 partially undermines the anatomical basis used by <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A%20new%20ornithurine%20bird%20(Hongshanornithidae)%20from%20the%20Jiufotang%20Formation%20of%20Chaoyang,%20Liaoning,%20China&amp;author=Li&amp;publication_year=2011\" title=\"A new ornithurine bird (Hongshanornithidae) from the Jiufotang Formation of Chaoyang, Liaoning, China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-28\">Li, Wang &amp; Hou (2011)</a> to diagnose the hongshanornithid <i>Parahongshanornis chaoyangensis</i>. The compression of the proximal portion of the furcula and caudal groove of this bone in DNHM D2945/6 indicate that these characters cannot be considered as diagnostic of <i>Parahongshanornis chaoyangensis</i>. This is the same for the distal expansion of the pubes, a condition that is identical in DNHM D2945/6 and the holotype of <i>Parahongshanornis chaoyangensis</i>.</p>\n<section class=\"sec\"><h3 class=\"heading\">Diet</h3>\n<p id=\"p-50\">The presence of teeth on both the maxilla and the dentary, and the reinterpretation of the hongshanornithids as toothed birds, impact earlier ecological inferences for the clade, suggesting they were less specialized trophically than previously imagined. The presence of at least two distinct skull morphologies within Hongshanornithidae indicates intraclade trophic diversity, and niche partitioning within the specialized wading ecology inferred to have been occupied by this clade.</p>\n<p id=\"p-51\">The geo-gastroliths preserved associated with the visceral region of DNHM D2945/6 offer a glimpse into the digestive system and dietary preferences of hongshanornithids. A variety of aquatic and terrestrial organisms regularly ingest sand, fine gravel, or coarse sand. These ‘stomach stones’ or grit are assumed to perform a variety of functions ranging from acting like ballast in aquatic animals to parasite control and hunger placation (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=A%20review%20of%20gastrolith%20function%20with%20implications%20for%20fossil%20vertebrates%20and%20a%20revised%20classification&amp;author=Wings&amp;publication_year=2007\" title=\"A review of gastrolith function with implications for fossil vertebrates and a revised classification\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-48\">Wings, 2007</a>).

In the case of DNHM D2945/6, the closely associated cluster of fairly evenly sized stones located in the abdominal cavity distal to the sternum but proximal to the pelvic girdle, is consistent with the interpretation of these geo-gastroliths as gizzard stones. Furthermore, the report by <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.1112694108\" title=\"Fossil evidence of avian crops from the Early Cretaceous of China\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-56\">Zheng et al. (2011)</a> of a specimen (STM 35-3, identified as of <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i>) containing seeds in a crop provides evidence that these birds were granivorous. Such evidence is consistent with both the preservation of geo-gastroliths in DNHM D2945/6 and STM 35-3, and the functional interpretation that highlights the role these stones play in processing hard foods.</p></section><section class=\"sec\"><h3 class=\"heading\">Caudal plumage</h3>\n<p id=\"p-52\">Very little is known about the rectrices of basal ornithuromorphs and DNHM D2945/6 represents what is possibly the most informative example for understanding the morphology of the tail of these birds.

The rectricial bulb is in turn supported by, and intimately connected to, the pygostyle. Nonetheless, because no direct evidence of a rectricial bulb has ever been found in any Mesozoic bird, whether the pygostyle is a reliable osteological correlate of the rectricial bulb has been questioned (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1469-7580.2006.00534.x\" title=\"Insight into the evolution of avian flight from a new clade of Early Cretaceous ornithurines from China and the morphology of Yixianornis grabaui\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-11\">Clarke, Zhou &amp; Zhang, 2006</a>). The morphology of the pygostyle of basal ornithuromorphs (and of their living relatives) differs from that typical of more basal birds, which commonly possess a long, robust, and club-shaped pygostyle (e.g., Confuciusornithidae, Enantiornithes). In contrast, the pygostyle of ornithuromorphs is relatively small, more delicate, and plough-shaped—even if the pygostyle of hongshanornithids is poorly known (and missing in DNHM 2945/6), its morphology seems to agree with that of other basal ornithuromorphs (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.0507106102\" title=\"Discovery of an ornithurine bird and its implication for Early Cretaceous avian radiation\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-60\">Zhou &amp; Zhang, 2005</a>).

Such evidence suggests that the presence of a large and club-shaped pygostyle, like the one characteristic of enantiornithines, might not have excluded the development of a fan-shaped feather tail among non-ornithuromorph birds from such tail feather morphologies (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F02724634.2009.10010371\" title=\"Phylogenetic support for a specialized clade of Cretaceous enantiornithine birds with information from a new species\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-37\">O’Connor et al., 2009</a>), and therefore that a rectricial bulb might have evolved either prior to the origin of the Ornithuromorpha or independently in more than one clade of birds (e.g., Ornithuromorpha and Enantiornithes). The derived phylogenetic position of <i>Shanweiniao cooperorum</i>, nested among advanced enantiornithines (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1080%2F14772019.2012.690455\" title=\"A redescription of Chaoyangia beishanensis (Aves) and a comprehensive phylogeny of Mesozoic birds\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-38\">O’Connor &amp; Zhou, 2012</a>), and the widespread presence of pintail morphologies lacking vaned rectrices capable of fanning among other enantiornithines (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Fgeosciences2030157\" title=\"Homology and potential cellular and molecular mechanisms for the development of unique feather morphologies in early birds\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-35\">O’Connor et al., 2012</a>) favor interpretations of the aerodynamic tail of <i>Shanweiniao</i> (and presumably the rectricial bulb that operated the fanning of its rectrices) as an independent evolutionary event. Likewise, the presence of fan-shaped feathered tails and modern-like pygostyles in a variety of basal ornithuromorphs (e.g., <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i>, <i>Yixianornis grabaui</i>, <i>Yanornis martini</i>, <i>Piscivoravis lii</i>) supports the argument that such morphologies are ancestral for Ornithuromorpha (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1469-7580.2006.00534.x\" title=\"Insight into the evolution of avian flight from a new clade of Early Cretaceous ornithurines from China and the morphology of Yixianornis grabaui\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-11\">Clarke, Zhou &amp; Zhang, 2006</a>).</p></section><section class=\"sec\"><h3 class=\"heading\">Aerodynamics</h3>\n<p id=\"p-55\">DNHM D2945/6 possesses relatively broad, but tapered wings. Compared to a general regression of mass against wing area for birds (data taken from <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Dimensional%20relationships%20for%20flying%20animals&amp;author=Greenewalt&amp;publication_year=1962\" title=\"Dimensional relationships for flying animals\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-18\">Greenewalt, 1962</a>), the relative wing area for DNHM D2945/6 is somewhat larger than average, when using the mean body mass estimate (42 g; residual of −0.37) (see Materials and Methods). However, using the heaviest mass estimate for DNHM D2945/6 (65 g) (see Materials and Methods) yields an average wing area, and therefore a typical wing loading compared to a modern bird of similar size (residual of −0.04).</p>\n<p id=\"p-56\">The overall size of DNHM D2945/6, along with its wing shape, is qualitatively similar to that of some living passerines with flexible diets (e.g., <i>Monticola solitarius</i>, <i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>, <i>Turdus naumanni</i>). These same living birds also tend to have somewhat tapering wings without extensive wing tip slotting. As a result, we tentatively suggest that DNHM D2945/6 may have lacked extensive wingtip slotting, even if direct evidence of this is not available in the specimen. Additional specimens will be required to confirm this prediction. Tip slots are most effective at slow speeds, where they can increase effective aspect ratio in wings with low geometric aspect ratio (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Gliding%20birds:%20reduction%20of%20induced%20drag%20by%20wing%20tip%20slots%20between%20primary%20feathers&amp;author=Tucker&amp;publication_year=1993\" title=\"Gliding birds: reduction of induced drag by wing tip slots between primary feathers\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-46\">Tucker, 1993</a>). As a result, it is generally expected that birds without tip slots tend to either have high geometric aspect ratio (which is not relevant to DNHM D2945/6), or else tend to fly at relatively high speeds. Based on its intermediate size and moderate aspect ratio, DNHM D2945/6 would be expected to flap continuously at low speeds, but may have switched to flap-bounding (a cycle of flapping and bounding with the wings flexed) at higher rates of travel, since this type of gait transition is seen among modern birds with similar wing shape and body size to DNHM D2945/6. We note that such gait transitions are related to flight speed and cost of transport, both of which relate to total body size and wing loading (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Kinematics%20of%20flap-bounding%20flight%20in%20the%20zebra%20finch%20over%20a%20wide%20range%20of%20speeds&amp;author=Tobalske&amp;publication_year=1999\" title=\"Kinematics of flap-bounding flight in the zebra finch over a wide range of speeds\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-45\">Tobalske, Peacock &amp; Dial, 1999</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1668%2F0003-1569%282001%29041%5B0177%3AMVAIFI%5D2.0.CO%3B2\" title=\"Morphology, velocity, and intermittent flight in birds\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-44\">Tobalske, 2001</a>). Since we have reliable measurements of the specimen dimensions, conservative predictions of gait are possible for DNHM D2945/6, even though the wings of the specimen lack feather details. For the same reasons, we do not expect that these gait transitions would be particularly sensitive to specifics of osteology (i.e., differences in skeletal structure between basal ornithuromorphs and modern birds). So long as DNHM D2945/6 was able to fly continuously for significant distances, the same basic patterns of cost of transport relative to size and flight speed should apply to both living neornithines and DNHM D2945/6.</p>\n<p id=\"p-57\">Tail positioning and effective functional area are more difficult to estimate in fossil taxa than the same variables for the wings, because avian tails can be used at extremely fanned or collapsed states (or any number of positions in between). While the degree of asymmetry of the rectrices is unclear, the lateral feathers of the tail in DNHM D2945/6 appear to be less asymmetrical than it would expected if these feathers were regularly oriented with their long axis fully transverse to the air flow (as would be the case for primary feathers on the wings or the lateral rectrices in a fully fanned tail). This suggests that the tail was typically deployed as a partially fanned “wedge”, rather than a full fan. This is not uncommon among modern birds with long tails, such as flycatchers, accipiters, and sunbitterns (M Habib, pers. observation).</p>\n<p id=\"p-58\">The preserved plumage of DNHM D2945/6 indicates that hongshanornithids had wing and tail surfaces comparable to those of living birds of similar sizes. In general, the morphology of the wing and feathered tail of DNHM D2945/6, combined with estimates of its weight, is indicative of a flight mode comparable to the intermittent flight of many medium-sized passerines and congruent with the conclusions reached by <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0036664\" title=\"Functional morphometric analysis of the furcula in Mesozoic birds\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-12\">Close &amp; Rayfield (2012)</a>, whose geometric morphometric analysis of furculae interpreted <i>Hongshanornis longicresta</i> as a continuous flapper.</p></section>"

        "The mutant form GGBP/H152C of the D-glucose/D-galactose-binding protein with the solvatochromic dye BADAN linked to cysteine residue Cys 152 can be used as a potential base for a sensitive element of glucose biosensor system. We investigated the influence of various external factors on the physical-chemical properties of GGBP/H152C-BADAN and its complex with glucose. The high affinity (Kd = 8.5 µM) and high binding rate of glucose make GGBP/H152C-BADAN a good candidate to determine the sugar content in biological fluids extracted using transdermal techniques. It was shown that changes in the ionic strength and pH of solution within the physiological range did not have a significant influence on the fluorescent characteristics of GGBP/H152C-BADAN. The mutant form GGBP/H152C has relatively low resistance to denaturation action of GdnHCl and urea.

The main drawback of such sensors is that its sensitive element is consumable due to the irreversible nature of the reaction of sensitive elements with analyte. A more promising direction for non-invasive glucometer design is the development of a biosensor system with a protein-sensitive element those reaction with glucose is reversible. Such proteins are concanavalin A and the D-glucose/D-galactose-binding protein (GGBP). The application of GGBP is promising because the protein–glucose binding promotes a significant change in the tertiary structure of GGBP (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1110%2Fps.073119507\" title=\"Engineering and rapid selection of a low-affinity glucose/galactose-binding protein for a glucose biosensor\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-1\">Amiss et al., 2007</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs10529-008-9712-7\" title=\"Engineering of ligand specificity of periplasmic binding protein for glucose sensing\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-23\">Sakaguchi-Mikami et al., 2008</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bios.2009.04.003\" title=\"Fluorescence lifetime spectroscopy and imaging of nano-engineered glucose sensor microcapsules based on glucose/galactose-binding protein\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-25\">Saxl et al., 2009</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1529%2Fbiophysj.106.087866\" title=\"The change of protein intradomain mobility on ligand binding: is it a commonly observed phenomenon?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-36\">Yesylevskyy, Kharkyanen &amp; Demchenko, 2006</a>).

        "In an attempt to determine if selection bias could be a reason that religious attendance and depression are related, the predictive value of elevated depressive symptoms for a decrease in future attendance at religious services was examined in a longitudinal panel of 1,673 Dutch adults. Religious attendance was assessed yearly over five years using the single question, “how often do you attend religious gatherings nowadays?” Depressive symptoms were assessed four times within the first year using the Depression subscale of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Logistic regression models of change in attendance were created, stratifying by baseline attendance status. Attenders who developed elevated symptoms were less likely to subsequently decrease their attendance (relative risk ratio: 0.55, 95% CI [0.38–0.79]) relative to baseline as compared to those without elevated symptoms. This inverse association remained significant after controlling for health and demographic covariates, and when using multiply imputed data to account for attrition. Non-attenders were unlikely to start attending after elevated depressive symptoms. This study provides counter evidence against previous findings that church attenders are a self-selected healthier group."

This inconsistency has been due in part to the predominance of cross-sectional designs, which cannot establish causation. We are aware of only three longitudinal studies examining the relation of depression to subsequent religious attendance. Recently, it was reported (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Faje%2Fkwr349\" title=\"Religious service attendance and major depression: a case of reverse causality?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-29\">Maselko et al., 2012</a>) that women having an onset of depression prior to age 18 were more likely to stop attending religious services as adults compared to those with adult-onset MDE and those with no lifetime MDE. Similarly, a longitudinal study (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F01.CHI.0000046831.09750.03\" title=\"Relation of intelligence and religiosity to depressive disorders in offspring of depressed and nondepressed mothers\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-22\">Horowitz &amp; Garber, 2003</a>) reported that depressive episodes in grades 7–11 predicted lower levels of religious attendance in grade 12. The latter result is ambiguous because religious attendance in grade 6 also predicted lower odds of depression in grades 7–12, although the effect was just shy of statistical significance. Miller and colleagues (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F00005053-200202000-00004\" title=\"Adult religiousness and history of childhood depression: eleven-year follow-up study\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-30\">2002</a>) followed a cohort of 146 individuals who had an MDE in childhood together with a control group of 123 who had no psychiatric disorder over 11 years. At follow-up, the rates of religious attendance between groups did not differ by childhood depression status. It is noteworthy that these studies covered the adolescence-to-adult transition period. Late adolescence is generally a time of profound change. The quest to establish one’s identity and career (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1037%2F0003-066X.55.5.469\" title=\"Emerging adulthood—a theory of development from the late teens through the twenties\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-1\">Arnett, 2000</a>) and experimentation with cohabitation, drugs, and alcohol (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1300%2FJ079v22n03_02\" title=\"A test of a model with reciprocal effects between religiosity and various forms of delinquency using 2-stage least squares regression\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-5\">Benda &amp; Corwyn, 1997</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F230051\" title=\"Reciprocal effects of religiosity, cohabitation, and marriage\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-39\">Thornton, Axinn &amp; Hill, 1992</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1353%2Fsof.2007.0083\" title=\"Losing my religion: the social sources of religious decline in early adulthood\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-40\">Uecker, Regnerus &amp; Vaaler, 2007</a>) could precipitate internal conflicts with religious doctrine, leading to declines in religious attendance. In short, the developmental processes occurring during adolescence confounds the relation of depression with religious attendance, in either causal direction.</p>\n<p id=\"p-2\">Selection effects might work in two ways to confound the relation of depression with subsequent religious attendance. First, depressed individuals may withdraw from public worship as part of the overall social disengagement that occurs in depression (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1093%2Faje%2Fkwr349\" title=\"Religious service attendance and major depression: a case of reverse causality?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-29\">Maselko et al., 2012</a>). Secondly, churchgoers might be less susceptible to depression. A meta-analysis of 94 studies reported a positive correlation of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and sociability with religious social investment (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F1088868306294590\" title=\"Social investment and personality: a meta-analysis of the relationship of personality traits to investment in work, family, religion, and volunteerism\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-27\">Lodi-Smith &amp; Roberts, 2007</a>). In summary, theory suggests that depressed individuals select themselves out of the churchgoing demographic while healthy ones select themselves into it. These selection effects, if operative, would likely overestimate the protective value of religion for mental health.</p>\n<p id=\"p-3\">The protective value of religiosity does have empirical support. Coping with adversity through religion is well-documented in the literature (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=The%20psychology%20of%20religion%20and%20coping:%20theory,%20research,%20practice&amp;author=Pargament&amp;publication_year=1997\" title=\"The psychology of religion and coping: theory, research, practice\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-32\">Pargament, 1997</a>). “Turning to God or religion” as a coping strategy has been reported in cancer patients (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2190%2F60W7-1661-2623-6042\" title=\"Relevance of religion and spirituality in German patients with chronic diseases\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-10\">Bussing, Ostermann &amp; Koenig, 2007</a>), newly bereaved individuals (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F0146167204263752\" title=\"Religion and emotional compensation: results from a prospective study of widowhood\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-8\">Brown et al., 2004</a>), and new immigrants (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2Fs12134-009-0097-9\" title=\"Immigrant religiosity in Canada: multiple trajectories\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-13\">Connor, 2009</a>).

Furthermore, increased religiosity was associated with greater CD4 helper cells in the blood, indicating slower HIV progression (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1525-1497.2006.00648.x\" title=\"An increase in religiousness/spirituality occurs after HIV diagnosis and predicts slower disease progression over 4 years in people with HIV\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-23\">Ironson, Stuetzle &amp; Fletcher, 2006</a>). A US longitudinal study reported that depressed individuals were more likely to seek religious consolation—defined as searching for meaning in problems and difficulties (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2F0021-8294.00017\" title=\"Religious consolation among men and women: do health problems spur seeking?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-19\">Ferraro &amp; Kelley-Moore, 2000</a>). Importantly, even those with no initial religious affiliation sought religious consolation after depression. This finding seems to support the “no atheists in foxholes” aphorism. However, adversity or trauma can also cause individuals to turn away from God or religion (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F01.nmd.0000198143.63662.fb\" title=\"Do people turn to religion in times of stress?: an examination of change in religiousness among elderly, medically ill patients\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-12\">Chen &amp; Koenig, 2006</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F01.nmd.0000138224.17375.55\" title=\"Trauma, change in strength of religious faith, and mental health service use among veterans treated for PTSD\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-20\">Fontana &amp; Rosenheck, 2004</a>).

The panel of almost 8,000 individuals was drawn from the Dutch-speaking population based on a list of addresses provided by Statistics Netherlands. The recruitment strategy is described in more detail elsewhere (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F0759106310387713\" title=\"Data collection in a probability-based internet panel: how the LISS panel was built and how it can be used\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-35\">Scherpenzeel, 2011</a>). LISS is a continuing study in which participants complete online questionnaires monthly on topics including family, economic situation, health, and religion. Each LISS participant has a unique member ID, so it is possible to combine their responses across different survey modules and from one wave to another. For the purpose of our study, we merged the religion (<i>n</i> = 7, 418) and mental health (<i>n</i> = 1, 804) modules, narrowing our sample to those who responded to both surveys (<i>n</i> = 1, 718) (see <a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-1\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-1\">Fig. 1A</a>). Waves of religion and depression assessments were not simultaneous, so hereafter, use the notations R<sub><i>i</i></sub> and D<sub><i>i</i></sub> to refer to religion and depression waves, respectively (see <a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-1\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-1\">Fig. 1B</a>). Our research question requires the following temporal sequence: R<sub>1</sub> → D<sub>2</sub> to D<sub>4</sub> → R<sub>2</sub>. By comparing attendance level at R<sub>2</sub> with R<sub>1</sub>, we can test whether depression predicts a relative decrease at R<sub>2</sub>. This design requirement forced us to exclude those individuals (<i>n</i> = 41) who had a different sequence of assessments:</p>\n<p id=\"p-6\">D<sub>1</sub> → D<sub>2</sub> → R<sub>1</sub> → D<sub>2</sub> to D<sub>4</sub> since for these individuals, one cannot compare attendance levels before and after depression.

We reverse coded the scale for ease of interpretation—i.e., larger number indicated higher attendance.

        "<h2 class=\"heading\">Results</h2>\n<p id=\"p-20\">Religious attenders were more likely to be female, older, and married as compared to non-attenders. Attenders and non-attenders were similar in self-rated health, in the proportion having chronic conditions, and in the distribution of BSI Depression normative scores. From March to September 2008, 491 individuals developed elevated depression. The chi-square tests in each of the four follow-up waves showed no association between depression status and subsequent decrease in attendance with one exception. In 2012, those with elevated BSI Depression among baseline attenders were more likely to keep or increase their 2008 attendance levels. In post-hoc analysis, we repeated the change in attendance analysis by depression category stratified first by gender and then by age category. In gender-stratified analysis, no associations were found in each attendance follow-up. In age-stratified analysis, no associations were found in the first two years after depression assessments took place. In both R<sub>3</sub> and R<sub>4</sub>, those 48 years old and above and with elevated depression were more likely to maintain or increase attendance levels (both <i>p</i>’s &lt; .05).

        "<h2 class=\"heading\">Discussion</h2>\n<p id=\"p-32\">The main finding in this study is that elevated BSI depression does not cause a subsequent decrease in attendance. On the contrary, elevated BSI depression predicts same or increased levels of attendance as compared with prior to elevated BSI depression. None of our results across three analytical strategies showed a decrease in attendance. Although unstratified analyses did not yield a significant association, gender and age-stratified results indicated an association of continued or increased attendance with elevated symptoms. We do not interpret this association because other variables could possibly explain the association. The multinomial logistic model among attenders, with covariates controlled for, indicated that elevated symptoms predicted same or increased attendance. As a secondary finding, non-attenders were not likely to seek recourse in religion by starting to attend services.</p>\n<p id=\"p-33\">Our main finding addresses the issue of selection bias in studies of religious attendance and mental health. To recap, when depressed individuals stop attending services, the apparent protection afforded by attendance would be inflated. This selection bias would be most pronounced in cross-sectional studies. In longitudinal epidemiologic studies, bias remains an issue because there might be differential attrition in attendance by depression status. Since we found that attenders who develop elevated symptoms become less likely to drop out of worship, then they might in effect be overrepresented among churchgoers. Therefore, the protective effect of religious attendance might in fact be underestimated, contrary to the reverse causation argument.</p>\n<p id=\"p-34\">Religious individuals turn to their faith in times of distress as a means of coping (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F0146167204263752\" title=\"Religion and emotional compensation: results from a prospective study of widowhood\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-8\">Brown et al., 2004</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2190%2F60W7-1661-2623-6042\" title=\"Relevance of religion and spirituality in German patients with chronic diseases\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-10\">Bussing, Ostermann &amp; Koenig, 2007</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1525-1497.2006.00648.x\" title=\"An increase in religiousness/spirituality occurs after HIV diagnosis and predicts slower disease progression over 4 years in people with HIV\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-23\">Ironson, Stuetzle &amp; Fletcher, 2006</a>). Religious worship is a source of social support and allows individuals to cope with life-threatening conditions by providing “medicine for the spirit” (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.3390%2Frel1010028\" title=\"Medicine for the spirit: religious coping in individuals with medical conditions\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-14\">Cummings &amp; Pargament, 2010</a>). A longitudinal study (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F002214650504600106\" title=\"Volunteering and depression in later life: social benefit or selection processes?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-26\">Li &amp; Ferraro, 2005</a>) on depression and volunteering among older adults reported that elevated depression at wave 2 predicted seeking out volunteering opportunities at wave 3. This was explained as a compensatory mechanism to alleviate negative affect, via social integration. These older adults had physical health problems in addition to depression and the physical health problems were the operative barriers. Consistent with this finding, <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F01.nmd.0000198143.63662.fb\" title=\"Do people turn to religion in times of stress?: an examination of change in religiousness among elderly, medically ill patients\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-12\">Chen &amp; Koenig (2006)</a> reported that in elderly, medically ill individuals, an increased severity of physical illness predicted a decrease in organizational religiousness. Importantly, the association was completely mediated by physical activity limitations. Together with our own results, these suggest that it is not depression <i>per se</i> that causes a disengagement from participation in religious service. In effect, reverse causation and non-random attrition might be more relevant to studies examining religious attendance and physical health.</p>\n<p id=\"p-35\">The null association of elevated depression with subsequent attendance among non-attenders indicates that non-attenders do not start attending in the face of adversity. By contrast, <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2F0021-8294.00017\" title=\"Religious consolation among men and women: do health problems spur seeking?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-19\">Ferraro &amp; Kelley-Moore (2000)</a> reported that depression, cancer, and chronic conditions lead to consolation-seeking even among those with no religious affiliation. The two points of view can be reconciled because attendance is not necessary for consolation-seeking. The need to find meaning in illness is shared by believers and non-believers who may turn to nature, arts, music, and relationships (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=The%20spiritual%20needs%20of%20atheists%20and%20agnostics&amp;author=Burnard&amp;publication_year=1988\" title=\"The spiritual needs of atheists and agnostics\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-9\">Burnard, 1988</a>).</p>\n<p id=\"p-36\">An intriguing study (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jesp.2013.05.008\" title=\"Scientific faith: belief in science increases in the face of stress and existential anxiety\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-18\">Farias et al., 2013</a>) reported that rowers about to enter a competition reported greater belief in science as compared with those in a training session. The authors concluded that affirming one’s secular worldview serves a similar function as religious faith in moments of stress or existential anxiety. Hence, affiliated individuals cope by means of religion while non-attending ones seek support and meaning elsewhere. It appears that depressive symptoms are not a strong driver of entry into or exit from the churchgoing demographic. More empirical research is needed to validate this interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"p-37\">Our study has several important limitations. First, we relied on the depression subscale of the BSI to assess depressive symptoms. It has been argued that although the global BSI scale is a valid measure of distress, it is not intended to screen for particular psychiatric disorders (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1037%2F1099-9809.12.2.367\" title=\"A cross-cultural analysis of the Brief Symptom Inventory-18\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-2\">Asner-Self, Schreiber &amp; Marotta, 2006</a>). We set the BSI cut-off for depression at “high” or “very high” but there is no way to tell whether this is in concordance with clinically diagnosed depression. We therefore allow for the possibility that the depressed group that we studied might differ from a group with formally diagnosed major depression (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1017%2FS003329171200284X\" title=\"Common mental disorder diagnosis and need for treatment are not the same: findings from a population-based longitudinal survey\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-34\">Sareen et al., 2013</a>). Secondly, there were no assessments of depression from 2009 to 2012—the period during which religious attendance was compared to initial attendance. As such, all religious attendance changes were indexed to depression levels in 2008 only. We cannot rule out the possibility that attendance levels after 2008 were related to unmeasured elevated symptoms after 2008. Third, the sample that we worked with was restricted to LISS participants who responded to both religion and mental health modules and might not be representative of the Dutch national population. Fourth, while we have ruled out sampling bias in terms of attrition in attendance, we could not address whether personality traits such as greater resilience to depression characterized attenders in the first place. Finally, other health-related reasons, including physical disability, might be correlated with depression and could cause selection bias. This is beyond the scope of our study. The major strength of this study was that depression assessments were proximal to those of religion. Our sample also consisted of a small fraction (5%) of late adolescents and is less affected by the well-reported decline in religious attendance in adolescence.</p>\n<p id=\"p-38\">Within the limitations of our study, we conclude that elevated depressive symptoms do not cause religiously affiliated individuals to subsequently decrease attendance at religious services.</p>"

        "Pendred syndrome (PDS) and DFNB4 comprise a phenotypic spectrum of sensorineural hearing loss disorders that typically result from biallelic mutations of the SLC26A4 gene. Although PDS and DFNB4 are recessively inherited, sequencing of the coding regions and splice sites of SLC26A4 in individuals suspected to be affected with these conditions often fails to identify two mutations. We investigated the potential contribution of large SLC26A4 deletions and duplications to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) by screening 107 probands with one known SLC26A4 mutation by Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). A heterozygous deletion, spanning exons 4–6, was detected in only one individual, accounting for approximately 1% of the missing mutations in our cohort. This low frequency is consistent with previously published MLPA results. We also examined the potential involvement of digenic inheritance in PDS/DFNB4 by sequencing the coding regions of FOXI1 and KCNJ10. Of the 29 probands who were sequenced, three carried nonsynonymous variants including one novel sequence change in FOXI1 and two polymorphisms in KCNJ10. We performed a review of prior studies and, in conjunction with our current data, conclude that the frequency of FOXI1 (1.4%) and KCNJ10 (3.6%) variants in PDS/DFNB4 individuals is low. Our results, in combination with previously published reports, indicate that large SLC26A4 deletions and duplications as well as mutations of FOXI1 and KCNJ10 play limited roles in the pathogenesis of SNHL and suggest that other genetic factors likely contribute to the phenotype."

Inheritance of hearing loss can be recessive, dominant, X-linked or mitochondrial, with autosomal recessive inheritance constituting roughly 80% of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).

There is considerable variability of symptoms. Vestibular dysfunction as well as non-pathognomonic temporal bone abnormalities, in particular enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA), can also be present in these conditions. DFNB4, also known as non-syndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (NS-EVA), is not associated with other clinical findings. PDS, in contrast, classically manifests additional symptoms such as the development of an incompletely penetrant euthyroid goiter, which can be present at birth but is more likely to develop in late childhood to early adulthood. PDS is also typically accompanied by Mondini dysplasia, a reduction of the number of turns of the cochlea combined with the characteristic bilateral EVA (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1586%2F14737159.6.3.375\" title=\"Hereditary sensorineural hearing loss: advances in molecular genetics and mutation analysis\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-33\">Schrijver &amp; Gardner, 2006</a>).

Intragenic deletions of <i>SLC26A4</i> as well as digenic mutations with either <i>FOXI1</i> or <i>KCNJ10</i> have all been implicated in PDS/DFNB4 pathogenesis but the extent of their involvement as well as their clinical relevance for SNHL remains unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"p-5\">We investigated the contribution of intragenic <i>SLC26A4</i> copy number changes by performing MLPA analysis on DNA samples from 107 probands with congenital SNHL who had only one identified <i>SLC26A4</i> mutation. Although it has been recommended to consider <i>SLC26A4</i> mutation analysis if there is progressive hearing loss, goiter, Mondini dysplasia, or EVA (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.mrrev.2008.08.002\" title=\"Forty-six genes causing nonsyndromic hearing impairment: which ones should be analyzed in DNA diagnostics?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-13\">Hilgert, Smith &amp; Van Camp, 2009</a>), the clinical testing strategy often adheres to the following algorithm: For individuals with congenital hearing loss that is consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance and that appears non-syndromic, diagnostic testing typically starts with <i>GJB2</i> sequence analysis. If clinical testing does not identify two pathogenic mutations, then inner ear imaging studies by MRI or CT for temporal bone anomalies may be performed. However, clinical testing of <i>SLC26A4</i> without MRI or CT is also considered acceptable because mutations in this gene are thought to be a frequent cause of SNHL (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1467/\" title=\"\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-1\">Alasti, Van Camp &amp; Smith, 1998</a>, updated 2012). This approach to the clinical work-up is quite common in the U.S., in part because the same DNA specimen can be used for both molecular tests sequentially and in part because imaging studies in the pediatric population can be challenging. As a result, our patients were selected based on the presence of congenital SNHL compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance, absence of two hearing loss-associated <i>GJB2</i> mutations, and the presence of only one known mutation in <i>SLC26A4</i>. In these individuals, we performed MLPA of <i>SLC26A4</i> and in a subset we also sequenced the coding regions and splice sites of <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i> to evaluate alternative etiologies.</p>"

Only one individual, PDS41, (1/107 unknown alleles; 0.93%) had MLPA results indicative of such a copy number variation—a putative heterozygous deletion spanning exons 4–6 of the gene (<a class=\"xref xref-fig\" href=\"#fig-1\" data-jats-ref-type=\"fig\" data-jats-rid=\"fig-1\">Fig. 1</a>).

In fact, an analysis of six studies with a total enrollment of 769 hearing impaired probands with EVA, a non-pathognomonic clinical finding that is a hallmark of PDS and DFNB4, reveals that only 25% have biallelic <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations (<a class=\"xref xref-table\" href=\"#table-2\" data-jats-ref-type=\"table\" data-jats-rid=\"table-2\">Table 2</a>).

This variation may be attributed to differences in the selection criteria of each study and/or to the patient population being tested; however, in all cases, there is a substantial proportion of individuals for whom the genotype is either incomplete or for whom no mutations in <i>SLC26A4</i> were identified at all. This has implications for genetic counseling regarding recurrence risk, whether to pursue imaging, and, more broadly, understanding of disease pathogenesis. The inability to identify both mutations in individuals suspected of having a PDS/DFNB4 hearing loss etiology suggests the possible involvement of (1) mutations in unexamined regions of <i>SLC26A4</i>; (2) mutations in other, as yet to be implicated genes; or (3) other factors, such as those that may regulate gene expression.</p>\n<figure class=\"table-wrap\" id=\"table-2\"><div class=\"caption\">\n<span class=\"caption-label\">Table 2: </span><div class=\"title\">Percentages of PDS/DFNB4 probands with <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"table-container\"><table class=\"table table-bordered table-condensed table-hover\">\n<colgroup>\n<col />\n<col />\n<col />\n<col />\n<col />\n<col />\n</colgroup>\n<thead><tr>\n<th>Reference</th>\n<th>Probands</th>\n<th>2 Mutations</th>\n<th>1 Mutation</th>\n<th>0 Mutations</th>\n<th>Study selection criteria</th>\n</tr></thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n                  <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Fhumu.1116\" title=\"Pendred syndrome, DFNB4, and PDS/SLC26A4 identification of eight novel mutations and possible genotype-phenotype correlations\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-6\">Campbell et al., 2001</a>\n                </td>\n<td>58</td>\n<td>9 (16%)</td>\n<td>14 (24%)</td>\n<td>35 (60%)</td>\n<td>Recessive HL with DVA or Mondini dysplasia</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n                  <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fsj.ejhg.5201073\" title=\"Distribution and frequencies of PDS (SLC26A4) mutations in Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct: a unique spectrum of mutations in Japanese\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-36\">Tsukamoto et al., 2003</a>\n                </td>\n<td>42</td>\n<td>24 (57%)</td>\n<td>10 (24%)</td>\n<td>8 (19%)</td>\n<td>Pendred (goiter) or bilateral HL with EVA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n                  <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1136%2Fjmg.2004.024208\" title=\"SLC26A4/PDS genotype–phenotype correlation in hearing loss with enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct (EVA): evidence that Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic EVA are distinct clinical and genetic entities\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-25\">Pryor et al., 2005</a>\n                </td>\n<td>39</td>\n<td>14 (36%)</td>\n<td>14 (36%)</td>\n<td>11 (28%)</td>\n<td>EVA in at least one ear</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n                  <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fsj.ejhg.5201611\" title=\"SLC26A4 gene is frequently involved in nonsyndromic hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueduct in Caucasian populations\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-2\">Albert et al., 2006</a>\n                </td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>24 (24%)</td>\n<td>16 (16%)</td>\n<td>60 (60%)</td>\n<td>Bilateral, recessive HL; EVA; no <i>GJB2</i> mutations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n                  <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F518314\" title=\"Transcriptional control of SLC26A4 is involved in Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of vestibular aqueduct (DFNB4)\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-40\">Yang et al., 2007</a>\n                </td>\n<td>429</td>\n<td>57 (13%)</td>\n<td>75 (17%)</td>\n<td>297 (69%)</td>\n<td>HL with EVA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n                  <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1159%2F000231567\" title=\"Phenotypic analyses and mutation screening of the SLC26A4 and FOXI1 genes in 101 Taiwanese families with bilateral nonsyndromic enlarged vestibular aqueduct (DFNB4) or Pendred syndrome\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-39\">Wu et al., 2010</a>\n                </td>\n<td>101</td>\n<td>63 (62%)</td>\n<td>24 (24%)</td>\n<td>14 (14%)</td>\n<td>Bilateral EVA</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n                  <b>Total</b>\n                </td>\n<td>769</td>\n<td>191 (25%)</td>\n<td>153 (20%)</td>\n<td>425 (55%)</td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<div class=\"object-id article-component-doi\">DOI: <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.384/table-2\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" title=\"Cite this object using this DOI\">10.7717/peerj.384/table-2</a>\n</div>\n<div class=\"table-wrap-foot\">\n<div class=\"fn\" id=\"table-2fn\"><p class=\"table-wrap-foot-notes\"><b>Notes:</b></p></div>\n<div class=\"fn\" id=\"table-2fn1\" data-jats-fn-type=\"other\"><p id=\"p-16\">\n              <dl id=\"dl1\">\n<dt>HL</dt>\n<dd><p id=\"p-17\">hearing loss</p></dd>\n<dt>DVA</dt>\n<dd><p id=\"p-18\">dilated vestibular aqueduct</p></dd>\n<dt>EVA</dt>\n<dd><p id=\"p-19\">enlarged vestibular aqueduct</p></dd>\n</dl>\n            </p></div>\n</div></figure><p id=\"p-20\">The selection of study subjects is an important factor that is not consistent between studies. Our patient selection was based primarily on the genetic testing of <i>GJB2</i> and <i>SLC26A4</i> as is common in the clinical work-up for children with SNHL in the U.S., with imaging studies performed on only a subset of patients. Even in this relatively general SNHL patient population, however, we saw a considerable enrichment for probands with single <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations, compared to unaffected individuals. In the experience of the Stanford Molecular Pathology Laboratory, the frequency of heterozygous <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations in probands tested with a <i>GJB2</i> and <i>SLC26A4</i> algorithm and in whom two pathogenic mutations are not identified is 12.3%, which is significantly higher (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than the expected carrier frequency. Using a frequency of 1/500 for congenital bilateral hearing loss of ≥40 dB (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.mrrev.2008.08.002\" title=\"Forty-six genes causing nonsyndromic hearing impairment: which ones should be analyzed in DNA diagnostics?\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-13\">Hilgert, Smith &amp; Van Camp, 2009</a>), and the estimate that <i>SLC26A4</i> related SNHL would account for up to 7.5%, then the frequency of such hearing loss could approximate one in 7,000. Assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the carrier frequency would be about 1:50 (2%). This is congruent with a study in which pathogenic or possibly pathogenic mutations were identified in 1.9% of normal-hearing controls (8/428 controls; p.E29Q, p.F354S, p.F667C, p.D724G, p.G740S) (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1073%2Fpnas.0805831105\" title=\"Functional assessment of allelic variants in the SLC26A4 gene involved in Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic EVA\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-24\">Pera et al., 2008b</a>). An “excess” of heterozygous mutations in individuals with SNHL compared to controls has also been observed for <i>GJB2</i> (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2FGIM.0b013e3180a03276\" title=\"A multicenter study of the frequency and distribution of GJB2 and GJB6 mutations in a large North American cohort\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-26\">Putcha et al., 2007</a>), a gene for which neighboring deletions can affect gene expression (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.bbrc.2009.08.152\" title=\"The digenic hypothesis unraveled: the GJB6 del(GJB6-D13S1830) mutation causes allele-specific loss of GJB2 expression in cis\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-29\">Rodriguez-Paris &amp; Schrijver, 2009</a>).</p>\n<p id=\"p-21\">Given that <i>SLC26A4</i> related SNHL is autosomal recessive, we postulated that these ‘missing’ <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations may be the result of intragenic deletions or duplications of one or more exons for which patients are not routinely tested. We selected 107 individuals with SNHL and monoallelic mutations of <i>SLC26A4</i> for MLPA analysis of the <i>SLC26A4</i> gene to explore this further.

Recently, however, in a study of 109 Scandinavian probands with suspected PDS/DFNB4, 37 individuals with only one or zero mutations of <i>SLC26A4</i> were systematically screened for copy number variants by MLPA (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fcge.12074\" title=\"SLC26A4 mutation frequency and spectrum in 109 Danish Pendred syndrome/DFNB4 probands and a report of nine novel mutations\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-28\">Rendtorff et al., 2013</a>). Only one harbored a homozygous deletion, of exons 4–6 (<i>n</i> = 2/63 unknown alleles; 3.2%). In our study of hearing impaired individuals with one previously identified <i>SLC26A4</i> mutation, we found an intragenic deletion in a single individual only (<i>n</i> = 1/107 unknown alleles; 0.93%). This deletion also spanned exons 4–6 of the <i>SLC26A4</i> gene and was previously detected in a patient of Spanish descent (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fejhg.2008.30\" title=\"A mutational analysis of the SLC26A4 gene in Spanish hearing-impaired families provides new insights into the genetic causes of Pendred syndrome and DFNB4 hearing loss\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-23\">Pera et al., 2008a</a>).

To date, deletions and duplications seem to represent approximately 1.8% of missing <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations overall (<i>n</i> = 3/170 unknown alleles) (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1111%2Fcge.12074\" title=\"SLC26A4 mutation frequency and spectrum in 109 Danish Pendred syndrome/DFNB4 probands and a report of nine novel mutations\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-28\">Rendtorff et al., 2013</a>; this study). Despite accounting for a low percentage of the ‘missing’ mutations, clinical testing for multiexon deletions and duplications of additional patients with potential PDS/DFNB4 etiology may remain warranted in order to more firmly establish frequencies and elucidate their relative contribution to the phenotype.</p>\n<p id=\"p-22\">Alternatively, unrecognized mutations in unexamined, noncoding regions of the gene may be responsible for the ‘missing’ <i>SLC26A4</i> mutations and contribute to the PDS/DFNB4 phenotype. For example, intronic mutations may create cryptic splice sites and mutations in the promoter region may disrupt the binding of regulatory elements. Indeed, a <i>cis</i>-regulatory element that binds transcription factor FOXI1 has been described in the <i>SLC26A4</i> promoter region (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F518314\" title=\"Transcriptional control of SLC26A4 is involved in Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of vestibular aqueduct (DFNB4)\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-40\">Yang et al., 2007</a>). The regulatory element consists of two head-to-head binding sites, FBS1 and FBS2, and a mutation within this <i>cis</i>-element, c.-103T&gt;C, has been shown to disrupt transcriptional activation of the gene by FOXI1. However, none of the probands included in this study carried mutations in the promoter region.</p>\n<p id=\"p-23\">Mutations of the <i>FOXI1</i> gene itself have also been implicated in PDS and DFNB4. Monoallelic variants of <i>FOXI1</i> were documented in six patients with either PDS or non-syndromic EVA and were shown to compromise the ability of FOXI1 to transcriptionally activate <i>SLC26A4</i> (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F518314\" title=\"Transcriptional control of SLC26A4 is involved in Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of vestibular aqueduct (DFNB4)\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-40\">Yang et al., 2007</a>). One of these six probands segregated the DFNB4 phenotype with one heterozygous mutation each of <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>SLC26A4</i>. This finding was consistent with the EVA phenotype observed in the <i>Slc26a4</i><sup>+/−</sup>; <i>Foxi</i>1<sup>+/−</sup> double-heterozygous mouse model and suggests that the transcriptional regulatory machinery of <i>SLC26A4</i> plays a role in PDS/DFNB4 pathogenesis. Mutations of <i>KCNJ10</i>, a gene that encodes a K<sup>+</sup> channel protein, have also been associated with PDS/DFNB4 (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1152%2Fajpcell.00312.2001\" title=\"KCNJ10 (Kir4.1) potassium channel knockout abolishes endocochlear potential\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-19\">Marcus et al., 2002</a>). Protein expression studies in <i>SLC26A4</i> knockout mice have indicated that the absence of pendrin expression reduces KCNJ10 protein levels, supporting the hypothesis that deafness in the mouse model is secondary to loss of KCNJ10 function (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1186%2F1741-7015-2-30\" title=\"Loss of KCNJ10 protein expression abolishes endocochlear potential and causes deafness in Pendred syndrome mouse model\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-38\">Wangemann et al., 2004</a>). A similar reduction of <i>KCNJ10</i> expression was observed in the stria vascularis of the inner ear in the haploinsufficient <i>Slc26a4</i><sup>+/−</sup> mouse mutant (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ajhg.2009.04.014\" title=\"Mutations of KCNJ10 together with mutations of SLC26A4 cause digenic nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-41\">Yang et al., 2009</a>). In that same study, two individuals with the PDS/DFNB4 phenotype were reported to be double heterozygous for mutations of the <i>SLC26A4</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i> genes, further supporting a digenic model of inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"p-24\">We examined to what extent digenic inheritance may contribute to the PDS/DFNB4 phenotype by sequencing the coding regions and splice sites of <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i> in about half (<i>n</i> = 29/60) of the Stanford University probands enrolled in the study for whom enough sample was available for the additional analysis. Our initial sequencing of <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i> in these subjects resulted in three nonsynonymous variants overall; all three of these heterozygous substitutions are listed in the dbSNP database as having unknown clinical significance. Nonetheless, functional studies must be conducted to investigate the effects of the <i>FOXI1</i> variant on <i>SLC26A4</i> transcriptional activation and the impact of the two <i>KCNJ10</i> variants on K<sup>+</sup> channel conductance before a determination of the pathogenicity of these three variants and their effect on SNHL phenotypes can be more definitively made.</p>\n<p id=\"p-25\">Although unlikely, if the <i>FOXI1</i> variant and the two <i>KCNJ10</i> variants detected in our probands are indeed digenic mutations acting in conjunction with mutations of <i>SLC26A4</i>, then 3.4% and 6.9% of the missing mutant alleles in our SNHL patients would be attributable to variants in <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i>, respectively. However, the number of patients tested for <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i> variants (<i>n</i> = 29/107 total probands) is too small a sample size to merit this conclusion. Consequently, a meta-analysis of published studies in which <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i> were sequenced in SNHL patients with inner ear malformations was conducted. The meta-analysis does not support the frequencies observed in our patients (<a class=\"xref xref-table\" href=\"#table-3\" data-jats-ref-type=\"table\" data-jats-rid=\"table-3\">Table 3</a>) and shows instead that, overall, 1.3% and 3.1% of suspected PDS/DFNB4 patients have variants in <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i>, respectively. In fact, considering that the <i>KCNJ10</i> variant c.812G&gt;A (p.Arg271His) may be a polymorphism in the Chinese population and the <i>KCNJ10</i> variant c.811C&gt;T (p.Arg271Cys) is a reported polymorphism in the dbSNP database, the frequency of <i>KCNJ10</i> variants in PDS/DFNB4 patients may be inflated by the inclusion of the Chinese and Italian probands carrying these substitutions and may actually be lower. The great majority of reported <i>FOXI1</i> and <i>KCNJ10</i> variants are from the initial studies that implicated the genes in the digenic inheritance of PDS/DFNB4 (<a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1086%2F518314\" title=\"Transcriptional control of SLC26A4 is involved in Pendred syndrome and nonsyndromic enlargement of vestibular aqueduct (DFNB4)\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-40\">Yang et al., 2007</a>; <a class=\"xref xref-bibr\" href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.ajhg.2009.04.014\" title=\"Mutations of KCNJ10 together with mutations of SLC26A4 cause digenic nonsyndromic hearing loss associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome\" data-jats-ref-type=\"bibr\" data-jats-rid=\"ref-41\">Yang et al., 2009</a>).

Subject PDS41 is heterozygous for a deletion (g.8091T-22145Cdel) spanning exons 4–6 in <i>SLC26A4</i>, as evidenced by the reproducible reduction in peak height for these three exon probes (peaks labeled 4, 5, 6) relative to the control. PDS41 also has a heterozygous c.1246A&gt;C (p.Thr416Pro) mutation that was previously identified by sequencing and confirmed by these MLPA results (peak labeled p.T416P).
