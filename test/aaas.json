Auxin and cytokinin are both critical for division and patterning, but it is unknown how these\n                        hormones converge upon tissue development. We identify a genetic network that reinforces an early embryonic bias in auxin\n                        distribution to create a local, nonresponding cytokinin source within the root vascular tissue. Experimental and theoretical\n                        evidence shows that these cells act as a tissue organizer by positioning the domain of oriented cell divisions. We further\n                        demonstrate that the auxin-cytokinin interaction acts as a spatial incoherent feed-forward loop, which is essential to generate\n                        distinct hormonal response zones, thus establishing a stable pattern within a growing vascular tissue.\n                     \n                     \n                  "

Notably, both scapulae of the juvenile Australopithecus afarensis skeleton from Dikika, Ethiopia, have been recovered. These scapulae display several traits characteristic of suspensory apes,\n                        as do the few known fragmentary adult australopith representatives. Many of these traits change significantly throughout modern\n                        human ontogeny, but remain stable in apes.

      "abstract": "Abstract\nPolarization of the T cell microtubule–organizing center (MTOC) to the immunological synapse between the T cell and an antigen-presenting cell (APC) maintains the specificity of T cell effector responses by enabling directional secretion toward the APC. The reorientation of the MTOC is guided by a sharp gradient of the second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG), which is centered at the immunological synapse. We used a single-cell photoactivation approach to demonstrate that diacylglycerol kinase α (DGK-α), which catalyzes the conversion of DAG to phosphatidic acid, determined T cell polarity by limiting the diffusion of DAG. DGK-α–deficient T cells exhibited enlarged accumulations of DAG at the immunological synapse, as well as impaired reorientation of the MTOC. In contrast, T cells lacking the related isoform DGK-ζ did not display polarization defects. We also found that DGK-α localized preferentially to the periphery of the immunological synapse, suggesting that it constrained the area over which DAG accumulated. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity was required for the peripheral localization pattern of DGK-α, which suggests a link between DAG and phosphatidylinositol signaling during T cell activation. These results reveal a previously unappreciated function of DGK-α and provide insight into the mechanisms that determine lymphocyte polarity.\n"

In rodents, these tasks require the hippocampus and are mediated by several inputs, particularly those\n                        originating in the locus coeruleus. These afferents mainly use norepinephrine as a transmitter. To explore the basis for contextual\n                        learning defects in Down syndrome, we examined the Ts65Dn mouse model. These mice, which have three copies of a fragment of\n                        mouse chromosome 16, exhibited significant deficits in contextual learning together with dysfunction and degeneration of locus\n                        coeruleus neurons. However, the postsynaptic targets of innervation remained responsive to noradrenergic receptor agonists.\n                        Indeed, despite advanced locus coeruleus degeneration, we were able to reverse contextual learning failure by using a prodrug\n                        for norepinephrine called l-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine, or xamoterol, a β1-adrenergic receptor partial agonist. Moreover, an increased gene dosage of App, in the context of Down syndrome, was necessary for locus coeruleus degeneration. Our findings raise the possibility that\n                        restoring norepinephrine-mediated neurotransmission could reverse cognitive dysfunction in Down syndrome.\n                     \n                     \n                  "

Evidence from the Drosophila midline axon guidance system suggests that the F-actin-microtubule cross-linker Short stop (Shot) might link the translation machinery to the cytoskeleton in the growth cone. The identification of a complex of translation factors attached to the actin and microtubule networks points to a mechanism by which cytoskeletal dynamics regulate translation in axons and vice versa.\n    "

The modern\n                        ascidian tadpole represents a plausible approximation to these ancestral chordates. To illuminate the origins of chordate\n                        and vertebrates, we generated a draft of the protein-coding portion of the genome of the most studied ascidian, Ciona intestinalis. TheCiona genome contains ∼16,000 protein-coding genes, similar to the number in other invertebrates, but only half that found in vertebrates.\n                        Vertebrate gene families are typically found in simplified form in Ciona, suggesting that ascidians contain the basic ancestral complement of genes involved in cell signaling and development. The\n                        ascidian genome has also acquired a number of lineage-specific innovations, including a group of genes engaged in cellulose\n                        metabolism that are related to those in bacteria and fungi.\n                     \n                  "
