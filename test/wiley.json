      "abstract": "Supercharged proteins are a new class of functional proteins with exceptional stability and potent ability to deliver bio‐macromolecules into cells. As a proof‐of‐principle, a novel application of supercharged proteins as a versatile biosensing platform for nucleic acid detection and epigenetics analysis is presented. Taking supercharged green fluorescent protein (ScGFP) as the signal reporter, a simple turn‐on homogenous method for DNA detection has been developed based on the polyionic nanoscale complex of ScGFP/DNA and toehold strand displacement. This assay shows high sensitivity and potent ability to detect single‐base mismatch. Furthermore, combined with bisulfite conversion, this ScGFP‐based assay was further applied to analyze site‐specific DNA methylation status of genomic DNA extracted from real human colon carcinoma tissue sample with ultrahigh sensitivity (4 amol methylated DNA)."

Soaking Ni2(dobdc) in sulfuric acid solutions at different pH values afforded new proton‐conducting frameworks, H+@Ni2(dobdc). At pH 1.8, the acidified MOF shows proton conductivity of 2.2×10−2 S cm−1 at 80 °C and 95 % relative humidity (RH), approaching the highest values reported for MOFs. Proton conduction occurs via the Grotthuss mechanism with a significantly low activation energy as compared to other proton‐conducting MOFs. Protonated water clusters within the pores of H+@Ni2(dobdc) play an important role in the conduction process."

Here, we use directed evolution to engineer an RebH variant, 3‐LR, with a Topt over 5 °C higher than that of wild‐type, and 3‐LSR, with a Tm 18 °C higher than that of wild‐type. These enzymes provided significantly improved conversion (up to fourfold) for halogenation of tryptophan and several non‐natural substrates. This initial evolution of RebH not only provides improved enzymes for immediate synthetic applications, but also establishes a robust protocol for further halogenase evolution."

As a result, di‐ and trifluoromethylated compounds were effectively produced in either equal or higher yields than identical reactions under batch conditions previously reported by Uneyamas group. The strategy of using electrochemical microreactor technology is useful for an effective fluoromethylation of alkenes based on Kolbe electrolysis in significantly shortened reaction times."

For this purpose, nine chloroplast barcodes, that is, accD, matK, rbcL, rpoA, rpoB, rpoC1, rpoC2, trnH‐psbA, trnL‐trnF, as well as ITS nuclear region, and intron of mitochondrial nad5 gene were tested. Among the single‐locus barcodes, most effective in the identification of Lamium species was the trnH‐psbA spacer and matK gene. The high level of variability and resolving power was also observed in the case of rpoA and rpoC2 genes. Despite the high interspecies variability of ITS region, it turned out to be inapplicable in Lamium identification. An important disadvantage of ITS as a barcode is a limitation of its use in polyploid plants, samples contaminated with fungal material or samples with partially degraded DNA. We have also evaluated five‐two‐locus and two‐three‐locus barcode regions created from a combination of most effective single loci. The best‐performing barcode combinations were matK + trnH‐psbA and matK + rpoA. Both of them had equally high discriminative power to identify Lamium species."

      "abstract": "In the Future Internet, federations are set up to cope with the stringent quality requirements of services. While a federated solution offers advantages in terms of scalability, it complicates the exchange of context (e.g. Quality of Service information of services) between federated nodes, as each node requires context to perform management tasks. In this article, we propose a context exchange process that automates the context communication between nodes. A scalable approach is proposed that is able to quickly react to local context updates, while maintaining a high level of expressivity to define relationships between federation partners. We distinguish between the context exchange inside an administrative domain, which focuses on scalability, and the context exchange between federation partners, which emphasizes the trust relationships between partners. In both cases, the process allows defining which context needs to be exchanged when and from where. Inside an administrative domain, a combination of RDF and SPARQL rules are used. This allows modeling the contextual requirements of management algorithms and automatically requesting remote context, only when it is necessary for the management algorithms to proceed. Between domains, an OWL‐based approach is used, which allows describing the complex relationships between federation partners. Triggered by the intra‐domain context exchange process, the contextual capabilities are communicated and refined through policies. Both type of processes are evaluated. The results show that they can infer which context is needed in a timely and scalable manner. As such, it outperforms approaches where context is broadcast both in required bandwidth and end‐to‐end delay. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

      "abstract": "Cooperative conformational transitions of proteins and nucleic acids are of decisive importance to many processes of molecular biology, and particularly to their regulation. They proceed via numerous interdependent elementary processes, and their kinetics are therefore often complicated. They are frequently also very fast. However, kinetic analyses can be carried out by chemical relaxation methods. The theoretical interpretation is comparatively simple in the case of linear biopolymers. When the linear Ising model extended for kinetics was applied to model peptides and polynucleotides, it provided an insight into the fundamental principles of cooperative transformations."
