      "description": "The use of an abundant and widely distributed seagrass species, Posidonia oceanica, as a biosorbent for the direct dye Yellow 44 was successfully shown. The studies were performed on the single dyestuff dissolved in water and in a dyebath containing agents commonly used in the textile industry, i.e. a surfactant (Lavotan TBU), a sequestring agent (Meropan DPE), a softening agent (Eurosoft CI10) and a salt (NaCl). The colour reduction results showed that P. oceanica was found to be more efficient for removal of Yellow 44 from an aqueous solution (162 mg g−1) than from a dyebath solution (135 mg g−1), according to the Langmuir isotherm model. For the single dyestuff sorption, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies highlighted chemical sorption between the dye alcohol function and the sorbent acid function. The chemical oxygen demand removal percentages were found to be 54.9 and 76.6% for Yellow 44 dissolved in aqueous solution and in dyebath solution, respectively. This conf..."

      "description": "Simultaneous analysis of land surface attributes and their seasonal changes provides a broader view of land-use and land-cover change. This study attempted to detect the change in inter-annual temporal vegetation dynamics, which reflects a change in land surface attributes. We explored 250-m multi-temporal MODIS EVI 16-day composite data from 2001 to 2007 to characterize a change in vegetation dynamics related to land-use change detection. The MODIS data was filtered in time-frequency space by wavelet function in order to identify and reduce the overall noise so as not to lose useful information from the time series data. The results show that by characterizing temporal vegetation dynamics, it is possible to distinguish actual land-use change based on land-cover dynamics. The result was evaluated using 18,626 reference pixels and showed an overall accuracy of 76.10%. In agricultural land use, such as upland and plantation, the weakest results were caused by mixed pixels from MODIS 250-m grid data as well ..."

The present study assessed the spatial distribution of LULC (1976–2008) in the high and low altitude zones in the northern highlands of Karatu, Tanzania, using both qualitative (in-depth interviews and focus group discussions) and quantitative techniques (Intensity Analysis). The qualitative approach was used to elicit information on the coping strategies adopted by land users as transitions occurred with time and the Intensity Analysis was used to assess the systematic land losses, gains and persistence of the various land categories with time. The results of the Intensity Analysis show that overall land transformation is decelerating in both agro-ecological zones across the two time intervals. In the low altitude zone, woodland, settlements and bushland are active categories unlike cultivated and grassland,..."

It reveals the pentasectional character of the triple flame, composed of the central pure diffusion-flame branch and the fuel-rich and fuel-lean branches, each of which is divided into two sections: a near-stoichiometric section and a previously unreported near-flammability-limits section with combined diffusion and premixed character. Results include propagation velocity, fuel and oxidiser mass fractions, temperature and reaction rates. Realistic stoichiometric ratios and reaction orders match experimental planar flame characteristics. Constant density, a one-step reaction, and a mixture fraction gradient at the inlet as the simulation parameter are imposed. The upstream equivalence ratio or the upstream reactant mass fractions are linear or hyperbolic functions of the transverse coordinate. The use here of experimental kinetics data di..."

By the end of the decade, the proliferation of the practice and the failure of the bar and bench to forbid it had made the criticism virtually moot. This article considers whether there is a basis for making the right to practice litigation public relations an obligation to do so. The article concludes that the right properly belongs to clients and not their attorneys, and finds a basis in contract and malpractice law for requiring attorneys to tend to their clients' interests in the court of public opinion as zealously as they do in courts of law."

However there is still little empirical knowledge about what specific kind of work emissions trading schemes do. Using the analytical tools provided by science and technology studies, especially developments studying markets and economic practices, this paper looks to contribute to filling this void by exploring three kinds of work that emissions trading schemes might do: performing a textbook market of emissions permits, performing a civilized market in which a multitude of heterogeneous actors participate and as exemplars of the validity of certain economic knowledge. In order to explore the usability of this conceptualization the paper will then analyze one of earliest concrete implementations of this device: an emissions trading scheme introduced to deal with indu..."
