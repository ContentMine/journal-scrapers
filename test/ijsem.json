The endophytic\n                     strain was isolated from Zn/Cd-accumulating Salix caprea in Arnoldstein, Austria. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene demonstrated that the novel strain is most closely related to members\n                     of the genus Spirosoma (95 % sequence similarity with Spirosoma linguale). The genomic DNA G+C content was 47.2 mol%. The predominant quinone was and the major cellular fatty acids were summed feature\n                     3 (iso-C15 : 0 2-OH and/or C16 : 1ω7c), C16 : 1ω5c, iso-C17 : 0 3-OH and iso-C15 : 0. On the basis of its phenotypic and genotypic properties, strain EX36T should be classified as a novel species of the genus Spirosoma, for which the name Spirosoma endophyticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is EX36T ( = DSM 26130T = LMG 27272T).\n                  \n                  \n               "

Although the bacterium was able to utilize organic substances such as acetate, pyruvate, peptone and yeast\n                     extract for growth, these compounds yielded considerably lower cell numbers than obtained with reduced sulfur or hydrogen;\n                     in addition, bicarbonate supplementation was necessary. The cells also had an absolute requirement for NaCl. Optimal growth\n                     occurred at 15 °C and at pH 6.6–8.0. The predominant fatty acid of this organism was 16 : 1ω7c, with 3-OH 14 : 0, 16 : 0, 16 : 1ω5c+t and 18 : 1ω7c present in smaller amounts. The DNA G+C content was 33.6 mol%. As determined in 16S rRNA gene sequence phylogeny analysis,\n                     the isolate belongs to the genus Sulfurimonas, within the class Epsilonproteobacteria, with 93.7 to 94.2 % similarity to the other species of the genus Sulfurimonas, Sulfurimonas autotrophica, Sulfurimonas paralvinellae and Sulfurimonas denitrificans. However, the distinct physiological and genotypic differences from these previously described taxa support the description\n                     of a novel species, Sulfurimonas gotlandica sp. nov. The type strain is GD1T ( = DSM 19862T = JCM 16533T). Our results also justify an emended description of the genus Sulfurimonas.\n                  \n                  \n               "

All five strains were isolated from the small intestine of a female child\n                     with coeliac disease. Cells of the five strains were short rods or coccoid cells with longer filamentous forms seen sporadically.\n                     The organisms produced acetic acid and succinic acid as major metabolic end products. Phylogenetic analysis based on comparative\n                     16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed close relationships between CD3 : 27, CD3 : 28T and CD3 : 33, between CD3 : 32 and Prevotella histicola CCUG 55407T, and between CD3 : 34 and Prevotella melaninogenica CCUG 4944BT. Strains CD3 : 27, CD3 : 28T and CD3 : 33 were clearly different from all recognized species within the genus Prevotella and related most closely to but distinct from P. melaninogenica. Based on 16S rRNA, RNA polymerase β-subunit (rpoB) and 60 kDa chaperonin protein subunit (cpn60) gene sequencing, and phenotypic, chemical and biochemical properties, strains CD3 : 27, CD3 : 28T and CD3 : 33 are considered to represent a novel species within the genus Prevotella, for which the name Prevotella jejuni sp. nov. is proposed. Strain CD3 : 28T ( = CCUG 60371T = DSM 26989T) is the type strain of the proposed novel species. All five strains were able to form homologous aggregates, in which tube-like\n                     structures were connecting individual bacteria cells. The five strains were able to bind to human intestinal carcinoma cell\n                     lines at 37 °C.\n                  \n                  \n               "

Four species of the genus Chondromyces are represented by dead herbarium samples as the type material. For a species of the genus Melittangium and two species of the genus Polyangium, no physical type material was assigned at the time of validation of the names or later on. In accordance with rule 18f of\n                     the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria the following type strains are designated for these species: strain Cm\n                     a14T ( = DSM 14605T = JCM 12615T) as the type strain of Chondromyces apiculatus, strain Cm c5T ( = DSM 14714T = JCM 12616T) as the type strain of Chondromyces crocatus, strain Sy t2T ( = DSM 14631T = JCM 12617T) as the type strain of Chondromyces lanuginosus, strain Cm p51T ( = DSM 14607T = JCM 12618T) as the type strain of Chondromyces pediculatus, strain Me b8T ( = DSM 14713T = JCM 12633T) as the type strain of Melittangium boletus, strain Pl s12T ( = DSM 14670T = JCM 12637T) as the type strain of Polyangium sorediatum and strain Pl sm5T ( = DSM 14734T = JCM 12638T) as the type strain of Polyangium spumosum. Furthermore, the type strains given for three species of the genera Cystobacter and Polyangium had been kept at one university institute and have been lost according to our investigations. In accordance with Rule 18c\n                     of the Bacteriological Code, we propose the following neotype strains: strain Cb fe18 ( = DSM 14716  = JCM 12624) as the neotype\n                     strain of Cystobacter ferrugineus, strain Cb m2 ( = DSM 14751 = JCM 12627) as the neotype strain of Cystobacter minus and strain Pl fu5 ( = DSM 14668 = JCM 12636) as the neotype strain of Polyangium fumosum. The proposals of the strains are based on the descriptions and strain proposals given in the respective chapters of Bergey’s Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (2005).\n                  \n                  \n               "

The type strain of the type species, Phaeobacter gallaeciensis BS107T, has been deposited at several public culture collections worldwide. Based on differences in plasmid profiles, we detected\n                     that the alleged P. gallaeciensis type strains deposited at the Collection Institute Pasteur (CIP; Paris, France) as CIP 105210 and at the German Collection\n                     of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (DSMZ; Braunschweig, Germany) as DSM 17395 are not identical. To determine the identity\n                     of these strains, we conducted DNA–DNA hybridization, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry\n                     (MALDI-TOF), 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses, as well as physiological experiments.\n                     Based on the detailed 16S rRNA gene reanalysis we showed that strain CIP 105210 most likely corresponds to the original P. gallaeciensis type strain BS107T. In contrast, the Phaeobacter strain DSM 17395 exhibits a much closer affiliation to Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 16374T ( = T5T) and should thus be allocated to this species. The detection of the dissimilarity of strains CIP 105210T and DSM 17395 will influence future comparative studies within the genus Phaeobacter.\n                  \n                  \n               "

(b) Calculated plasmid sizes as mean values taken from at least two different\n                              gel runs. The PFGE conditions were: 1 % (w/v) agarose gel with pulse times of 1 to 48 s for 24 h at 200 V (6 V cm−1). Chr, chromosomal DNA; λ, lambda phage concatemers as molecular-mass PFGE markers (New England Biolabs); li, linear. (*), The two largest plasmids (linearized forms) of Phaeobacter strains CIP 105210T and DSM 17395 migrated about the same distance in the gel and thus seemed to have an identical size. In contrast, both bands\n                              could be clearly distinguished by their size in other PFGE runs (data not shown) using different DNA sample preparations.\n                              DNA mobility is largely influenced by the DNA concentration of the sample. The observed discrepancy can thus be explained\n                              by the relatively high DNA concentration in CIP 105210T (compared to DSM 17395T), which retards band migration (Römling et al., 1996).

Therefore, the relationship between the two species was investigated by a taxonomic study that included, in addition to\n                     re-evaluation of the 16S rRNA gene sequence, determination of DNA–DNA binding and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of housekeeping\n                     genes encoding the DNA-directed RNA polymerase B subunit (rpoC), putative xylulose-5-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (xfp), elongation factor EF-G (fusA), 50S ribosomal protein L2 (rplB) and DNA gyrase B subunit (gyrB). Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed relatively high similarity (98.9 %) between B. stercoris KCTC 5756T and B. adolescentis ATCC 15703T. MLSA revealed close relatedness between B. stercoris KCTC 5756T and B. adolescentis CCUG 18363T, with 99.3–100 % similarity between the rpoC, xfp, fusA, rplB and gyrB gene sequences. In addition, relatively high dnaJ1 gene sequence similarity of 97.7 % was found between the strains. Similar phenotypes and a high DNA–DNA binding value (78.9 %)\n                     confirmed that B. stercoris and B. adolescentis are synonymous. Based on these results, it is proposed that the species Bifidobacterium stercoris Kim et al. 2010 should be reclassified as a later heterotypic synonym of Bifidobacterium adolescentis Reuter 1963 (Approved Lists 1980).\n                  \n                  \n               "
