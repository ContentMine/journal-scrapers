Single-core multimodal probes for imaging (SCoMPIs) display unique photophysical properties enabling their unequivocal detection in cells. New SCoMPIs were prepared from an ancillary 1-(2-pyridyl)-1,2,3-triazole ligand, denoted Tapy, a regioisomer of the widely used Pyta ligand. When functionalized with long alkyl chains, they show impressive enhancement of their luminescent properties relative to the parent Pyta complex, both in solution and in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells."

Complexes with benzothiadiazole–triazole ligands show interesting luminescent quantum yields in acetonitrile and may constitute valuable luminescent metal complexes in organic media. A series of complexes with bidentate 1-(2-quinolinyl)-1,2,3-triazole (Taquin) and 1-(2-pyridyl)-1,2,3-triazole (Tapy) ligands bearing various 4-substituted alkyl side chains has been designed and synthesized with efficient procedures. Their photophysical properties have been characterized in acetonitrile and in a H2O/DMSO (98/2) mixture and compared with those of the parent Quinta- and Pyta-based complexes. Tapy complexes bearing long alkyl chains show impressive enhancement of their luminescent properties relative to the parent Pyta complex. Theoretical calculations have been performed to further characterize this new class of rhenium tricarbonyl complexes. Preliminary cellular imaging studies in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells reveal a strong increase in the luminescence signal in cells incubated with the Tapy complex substituted with a C12 alkyl chain. This study points out the interesting potential of the Tapy ligand in coordination chemistry, which has been so far underexploited."

The latter work with a simplified reaction mixture, one that removes the photo-induced reduction step with a sacrificial donor, is used for validation of the proposed mechanism, which involves formation of a rhenium carboxylate dimer, [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO), where dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine. CO2 insertion into this species, and subsequent rearrangement, is proposed to yield CO and the carbonate-bridged [Re(dmb)(CO)3]2(OCO2). Structures and energies for the proposed reaction path are presented and compared to previously published experimental observations."

We have developed a variety of databases for testing and designing new density functionals. We used these data to design new density functionals, called M06-class (and, earlier, M05-class) functionals, for which we enforced some fundamental exact constraints such as the uniform-electron-gas limit and the absence of self-correlation energy. Our M06-class functionals depend on spin-up and spin-down electron densities (i.e., spin densities), spin density gradients, spin kinetic energy densities, and, for nonlocal (also called hybrid) functionals, Hartree−Fock exchange. We have developed four new functionals that overcome the above-mentioned difficulties: (a) M06, a hybrid meta functional, is a functional with good accuracy “across-the-board” for transition metals, main group thermochemistry, medium-range correlation energy, and barrier heights; (b) M06-2X, another hybrid meta functional, is not good for transition metals but has excellent performance for main group chemistry, predicts accurate valence and Rydberg electronic excitation energies, and is an excellent functional for aromatic−aromatic stacking interactions; (c) M06-L is not as accurate as M06 for barrier heights but is the most accurate functional for transition metals and is the only local functional (no Hartree−Fock exchange) with better across-the-board average performance than B3LYP; this is very important because only local functionals are affordable for many demanding applications on very large systems; (d) M06-HF has good performance for valence, Rydberg, and charge transfer excited states with minimal sacrifice of ground-state accuracy. In this Account, we compared the performance of the M06-class functionals and one M05-class functional (M05-2X) to that of some popular functionals for diverse databases and their performance on several difficult cases. The tests include barrier heights, conformational energy, and the trend in bond dissociation energies of Grubbsʼ ruthenium catalysts for olefin metathesis. Based on these tests, we recommend (1) the M06-2X, BMK, and M05-2X functionals for main-group thermochemistry and kinetics, (2) M06-2X and M06 for systems where main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions are all important, (3) M06-L and M06 for transition metal thermochemistry, (4) M06 for problems involving multireference rearrangements or reactions where both organic and transition-metal bonds are formed or broken, (5) M06-2X, M05-2X, M06-HF, M06, and M06-L for the study of noncovalent interactions, (6) M06-HF when the use of full Hartree−Fock exchange is important, for example, to avoid the error of self-interaction at long-range, (7) M06-L when a local functional is required, because a local functional has much lower cost for large systems."

      "abstract": "This article describes the results of an IR spectroelectrochemical study of the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide using the complexes [Re(CO)3(bpy)L]n (bpy = 2,2‘-bipyridine; n = 0, L = Cl-, CF3SO3-; n = +1, L = CH3CN, P(OEt)3) as catalyst precursors. The study was performed for the first time with an optically transparent thin-layer electrochemical (OTTLE) cell. The results confirm unambiguously the catalytic activity of the reduced five-coordinate complexes, the radical [Re(CO)3(bpy)]• and the anion [Re(CO)3(bpy)]-. The catalytic behavior of these species could be investigated separately for the first time due to the application of complexes other than those with L = halide, whose catalytic routes may involve simultaneously both radical and anionic catalysis depending on the solvent used. The complex [Re(CO)3(bpy)Cl], so far the most studied catalyst precursor, upon one-electron reduction gives the corresponding radical-anion [Re(CO)3(bpy)Cl]•-, which was previously believed to react directly with CO2. By contrast, this study demonstrates its stability toward attack by CO2, which may only take place after dissociation of the chloride ligand. This conclusion also applies to other six-coordinate radicals [Re(CO)3(bpy)L]• (L = CH3CN (in CH3CN) and P(OEt)3) whose catalytic route requires subsequent one-electron reduction to produce the anionic catalyst [Re(CO)3(bpy)]- (the 2e pathway). The catalytic route of [Re(CO)3(bpy)Cl] in CH3CN therefore deviates from that of the related [Re(CO)3(dmbpy)Cl], the other complex studied by IR (reflectance) spectroelectrochemistry, with the more basic ligand, 4,4‘-dimethyl-2,2‘-bipyridine (dmbpy). The latter complex tends to form the five-coordinate radicals [Re(CO)3(dmbpy)]•, capable of CO2 reduction (the 1e pathway), even in CH3CN, hence eliminating the possibility of the 2e pathway via the anion [Re(CO)3(dmbpy)]-, which operates in the case of the 2,2‘-bipyridine complex. For [Re(CO)3(bpy)L]n (n = 0, L = Cl-, CF3SO3-; n = +1, L = CH3CN), the 1e catalytic route becomes possible in weakly coordinating THF, due to the instability of the radical [Re(CO)3(bpy)(THF)]•. The inherent stability of the radical [Re(CO)3(bpy){P(OEt)3}]• was found convenient for the investigation of the 2e pathway via [Re(CO)3(bpy)]-. The main, spectroscopically observed products of the CO2 reduction are, independent of the 1e and 2e catalytic routes, CO, CO32-, and free CO2H-. The latter product is formed via one-electron reduction of the radical anion [Re(CO)3(bpy)(CO2H)]•-, which is the main byproduct in the catalytic cycle. "
